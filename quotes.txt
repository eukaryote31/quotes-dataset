Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home.
Be not entangled in this world of days and nights; Thou hast another time and space as well.
Be passionate and bold. Always keep learning. You stop doing useful things if you don't learn. So the last part to me is the key, especially if you have had some initial success. It becomes even more critical that you have the learning 'bit' always switched on.
Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure, there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together, and if you're really working, you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.

Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
Bitcoin has a tremendous 'network effect', in my opinion, which may give it an insurmountable early-mover advantage. In technology it is often not the best technology that "wins", but the one that achieves broad enough adoption and recognition early enough. Good enough beats best if deployed broadly.
Bitcoin is at the same stage as the Internet in 1992-1993. At that time, it took UNIX command-line skills to send email. No way near ready for mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin is created electronically and exchanged between users without passing by a financial intermediary.
Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits the power of the long tail.
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love.
Blockchain is the tech. Bitcoin is merely the first mainstream manifestation of its potential.

Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility.
Breakdowns can create breakthroughs. Things fall apart so things can fall together.

Business gives you a massive high. Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution... It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.

Challenge is the pathway to engagement and progress in our lives. But not all challenges are created equal. Some challenges make us feel alive, engaged, connected, and fulfilled.

Choose not to be harmed, and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed, and you haven't been.

Confidence is preparation. Everything else is beyond your control.
Confidence, like art, never comes from having all the answers; it comes from being open to all the questions.

Create each day anew.
Create. Not for the money. Not for the fame. Not for the recognition. But for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it.
Creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity.

Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity.
Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent; it clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you.

Education, actual learning--it is hard work. It's very personal. Your parents don't teach you anything. Your teachers don't teach you anything. The government doesn't teach you anything. You read it. You don't understand it; you read it again. You break a pencil and read it again.

Entrepreneurship is like a computer game in which you have to master every level before achieving success. Startups repeatedly stumble and have to go back to the drawing board. The best way to skip some levels and to increase the odds of survival is to learn from others who have already played the game.
Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice.

Everybody lies, but it doesn't matter since nobody listens.
Everybody makes their own fun. If you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun -- it's entertainment.

For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in the programs they produce.

The more you concentrate on these two challenges, the clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin: teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable.

Hard work and dedication is important to success, and I have those qualities.
Hard work pays off in the future. Laziness pays off now.
Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.
Hasta la vista, baby.
Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success.
Have respect for yourself, and patience and compassion. With these, you can handle anything.
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.

Hawaii is not a state of mind, but a state of grace.
Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.
Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend. Non-being is the greatest joy.
Health, learning and virtue will ensure your happiness; they will give you a quiet conscience, private esteem and public honour.
Heaven on Earth is a choice you must make, not a place we must find.
Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.

Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
Help yourself, then everyone will help you. Principle of neighbor-love.
Here's Johnny!
Here's looking at you, kid.
He's supposed to sound like he's in pain, he's a folk singer.
He stands erect by bending over the fallen. He rises by lifting others.
He that has patience may compass anything.
He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.
He understood well enough how a man with a choice between pride and responsibility will almost always choose pride if responsibility robs him of his manhood.
He was a great patriot, a humanitarian, a loyal friend; provided, of course, he really is dead.
He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.
He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal.
He who conquers others is strong, he who conquers himself is mighty.
He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg.
He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a despiser.
He who expects no gratitude shall never be disappointed.
He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.
He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.

He who has faith has... an inward reservoir of courage, hope, confidence, calmness, and assuring trust that all will come out well - even though to the world it may appear to come out most badly.
He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even himself--only in relation to his pupils.
He who laughs last didn't understand the joke

He who wishes to secure the good of others, has already secured his own.
He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying.
Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.
Hire people smarter than you. Work with people smarter than you. Listen to them. Let them lead you. Take the blame for all failures, give away the credit for all successes.
History is endured only by strong personalities -- the weak ones are extinguished by it.
Hitch your wagon to a star.
Hold fast to dreams. For if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.
Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody else expects of you, never excuse yourself.
Honest towards ourselves and towards anyone else who is our friend; brave towards the enemy; magnanimous towards the defeated; polite always: this is how the four cardinal virtues want us to act.
Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life - all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity.
Honesty and loyalty are key. If two people can be honest with each other about everything, that's probably the biggest key to success.
Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyway.
Honesty is the cornerstone of all success, without which confidence and ability to perform shall cease to exist.
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
Honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual, corporation, or product.
Hope, deceitful though it be, is at least of this good use to us that while we are travelling through this life, it conducts us by an easier and more pleasant way to our journey's end.
Hopefully I'll continue to have the success I've had.
Hopefully, when people see 'Senna', they will understand why this inspirational story needed to be told, why it had to be made as a movie for the big screen, and why it is a film for everyone.
Hope is always available to us. When we feel defeated, we need only take a deep breath and say, "Yes," and hope will reappear.
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.
Hope is but the dream of those who wake.
Hope is some extraordinary spiritual grace that God gives us to control our fears, not to oust them.
Hope... is the companion of power, and the mother of success; for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles.
Hope is the dream of a soul awake.
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.
Hope will never be silent.
Houston, we have a problem.
How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same?
How can I be useful, of what service can I be? There is something inside me, what can it be?
How can they say my life is not a success? Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten?
How does one measure the success of a museum?
How do you know you're going to do something, untill you do it?
How do you tell when you run out of invisible ink?
How easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success.

However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
However things may seem, no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure.
How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains!
How little is required for pleasure! The sound of a bagpipe. Without music, life would be an error. The German imagines even God singing songs.
How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself.
"How much conscience has had to chew on in the past! And what excellent teeth it had! And today--what is lacking?" A dentist's question.

Human diversity makes tolerance more than a virtue; it makes it a requirement for survival.
Human history begins with man's act of disobedience which is at the very same time the beginning of his freedom and development of his reason.
Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.
Humility is the true key to success. Successful people lose their way at times. They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits of success. Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap. Humble people share the credit and wealth, remaining focused and hungry to continue the journey of success.
Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them.
Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
Humor has bailed me out of more tight situations than I can think of. If you go with your instincts and keep your humor, creativity follows. With luck, success comes, too.
Humor is mankind's greatest blessing.
I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples.
I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of, Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough.
I always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success, but you never know what it feels like or how you're going to be when you're there.

I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.
I always say be humble but be firm. Humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs.
I always win. Except when I lose, but then I just don't count it.
"I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you."
I am an enthusiast, but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine. I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success.
I am a part of all that I have met.
I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.
I am big! It's the pictures that got small.
I am convinced that America's great sea of goodwill can be, in fact, a rising tide, a tide that could lift every veteran and every family of our wounded and fallen.

I am deliberate and afraid of nothing.
I am fully aware that everybody has a right to succeed, and success should be with ethics.

I am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to Laker success.
I am hitting my head against the walls, but the walls are giving way.
I am never without my lyric book. If anything inspirational happens, I have it there so nothing's forgotten.

I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today!
I am not a has-been. I am a will be.
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
I am not a vegetarian because I love animals; I am a vegetarian because I hate plants.
I am not young enough to know everything.
I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.
I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil's attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth.
I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.
I am so fresh in soul and spirit that life gushes and bubbles around me in a thousand springs.
I am stable when my private life is a success.
I am very conscious of who I am as an artist and as an inspirational person.
I am very optimistic, and I wish that God almighty grants me success to get a qualifying time. Only then can I go to the Olympics. If this happens I will be the first Palestinian athlete to gain a qualifying time. This will be a big achievement.
I am your father.
I appreciate people who are civil, whether they mean it or not. I think: Be civil. Do not cherish your opinion over my feelings. There's a vanity to candor that isn't really worth it. Be kind.
I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties.
I arise full of eagerness and energy, knowing well what achievement lies ahead of me.
I attribute my success to my mental approach to the game. I have always been a serious student of umpiring. I enjoy studying rules, situations, and positioning.

I believe in the city as a natural human environment, but we must humanize it. It's art that will re-define public space in the 21st Century. We can make our cities diverse, inspirational places by putting art, dance and performance in all its forms into the matrix of street life.
I believe in the dignity of labor, whether with head or hand; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I believe it is in my nature to dance by virtue of the beat of my heart, the pulse of my blood and the music in my mind.
I believe success is preparation, because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that?
I believe that any type of education can be great, but an education about ourselves can create something wonderful. I am a comedian, but people have called me a motivational speaker. I don't really consider myself that at all.

I believe that if one always looked at the skies, one would end up with wings.

I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.
I can and I will. Watch me.
I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome.
I can live for two months on a good compliment.
I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.
I cannot help you, for I am just a cookie.
I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better.
I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.
I can say the willingness to get dirty has always defined us as an nation, and it's a hallmark of hard work and a hallmark of fun, and dirt is not the enemy.
I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
I can, therefore I am.

I congratulate you, my brave countrymen and fellow soldiers, on the spirit and success with which you have executed this important part of our enterprise.
I count life just a stuff, to try the soul's strength on.
Ideas are a dime a dozen. People who implement them are priceless.
Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the door is just one more good idea.
Ideas shape the course of history.
I define success as being comfortable with yourself and your life. And that is about as good as it gets, really.
I demolish my bridges behind me...then there is no choice but to move forward.
I did an A Level in Theatre Studies and had a really inspirational teacher, and then I just went on to university.
I didn't fail the test. I just found 100 ways to do it wrong.
I didn't say it was your fault. I said I was going to blame you.
I did stand-up comedy for 18 years. Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four years were spent in wild success. I was seeking comic originality, and fame fell on me as a byproduct. The course was more plodding than heroic.
"I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.
I discovered at a very early age that if I talked for long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So, either I'm God, or truth is relative. Eitherway, booyah.
"I dislike him."--Why?--"I am not a match for him."--Did any one ever answer so?
Idleness is the beginning of all psychology. What? Should psychology be a vice?
I'd like to one day be featured on a list of inspirational people who have made a difference in the world, whether it be helping underprivileged people or putting an end to the poaching of wildlife in Africa.
I do a lot of inspirational talks for kids, to motivate them to change their lives and give them hope.
I do like alternative rock and rap, but as far as inspirational, then I go full-on orchestra. It fills up your entire being.
I do love to eavesdrop. It's inspirational, not only for subject matter but for actual dialogue, the way people talk.
I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but it should get you pretty near.

I do not like to repeat successes, I like to go on to other things.
I do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature.
I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.
I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.
I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.
I don't count my sit-ups; I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count.
I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.
I don't dwell on success. Maybe that's one reason I'm successful.
I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.
I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure. He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.
I don't know what keeps me going. Sometimes I wonder... I think it's just pure perseverance and wanting to succeed and having that burning desire to always have success.

I don't think 'Cocktail' was a perfect critical success, but it touched a vein in our culture.

I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.
I'd rather write programs to write programs than write programs.
I drink your milkshake!

If a man does his best, what else is there?

If a woman has manly virtues, one feels like running away; and if she has no manly virtues, she herself runs away.

If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
I feel it is everybody's obligation to reach for the best in themselves and use that for the interest of mankind.
I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started.
I feel lucky because I was a nerd, which I talk about in the book, but I had academic success, so through that, because that's what my parents put a great deal of value on, I had a great childhood because I sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school.

If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any way in which I would ever have made progress.

If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.
I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.
I find television very educational. Every time someone switches it on I go into another room and read a good book.
I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.
I find that when you have a real interest in life and a curious life, that sleep is not the most important thing.
I firmly believe that unless one has tasted the bitter pill of failure, one cannot aspire enough for success.
If it boils and is watched, it can't be a pot.

I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.
If people are not laughing at your goals, your goals are too small.
If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do.

If someone says 'grunge' or 'punk,' you know what the sound is, but if you say 'No Wave,' it's kind of mysterious. That was the most interesting part and should have been the most inspirational thing about it... here's this collective sonic insanity, and none of it sounds anything alike.

If there is no struggle, there is no progress.
If there were no night, we would not appreciate the day, nor could we see the stars and the vastness of the heavens. We must partake of the bitter with the sweet. There is a divine purpose in the adversities we encounter every day. They prepare, they purge, they purify, and thus they bless.

I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it.

I know you've heard it a thousand times before. But it's true--hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don't love something, then don't do it.
I learned pretty soon that it was essential to fail and be foolish.
I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.

I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

I'm a bit of a P. T. Barnum. I make stars out of everyone.
I made a resolve then that I was going to amount to something if I could. And no hours, nor amount of labor, nor amount of money would deter me from giving the best that there was in me. And I have done that ever since, and I win by it. I know.
I'm a designer, and I work very hard at that. People sometimes want to put down fashion by saying it's frivolous or superficial, but it's not that way at all. It's actually very hard work.
I'm a gay disabled man who has become very successful. I don't get up in the morning and think I'm inspirational; I just get up thinking that I love horses.

I'm better than P. T. Barnum and Colonel Parker put together.

I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life.
I'm happy to be on a winning team. My individual success, that lasts for a short period of time. The success of being a part of the South, of Atlanta, which is now the hot bed of music, that's what's gonna last the longest. The fact that I contributed to planting our flag and moving music to my city, that's what I'm most proud of.
I'm having a deja vu experience, just like last time.
I'm having an old friend for dinner.
I'm intimidated by the fear of being average.
I mistrust all systematizers and I avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
I'm lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.

I'm not an inspirational quote kind of person.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not going to get somewhere and say, 'OK, I'm done.' Success is never final; I'll just keep on going. The same way as failure never being fatal. Just keep going. I'm going to the stars and then past them.
I'm not happy on vacation. In those rare times when I have three hours with no work I have to do, I'm terribly uncomfortable.
I'm not here to impose Sharia law, and I'm not here to have a message about disability being inspirational - I'm here to make people laugh. But when I can layer things and make people not only laugh but question, make people not only laugh but be offended... I have to do that.
I'm not really easy to live with! There needs to be unlimited patience and unconditional love. Men I've known before loved my independent spirit and were proud of my success, to the point that they'd become jealous of the time I devote to my career.
I'm not stupid. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.
Impossibilities are merely things which we have not yet learned.

I must admit that I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings.
I'm very fond of the British cinema. I'm a big fan of Martin Campbell and Daniel Craig. I actually find Daniel very inspirational, especially on the physical side of things. He really inspired me to get back into shape when I started to add on a few pounds. I think he's a great role model.
I'm walking here! I'm walking here!
In 20 years, you probably won't even remember this.
In a balanced organization, working towards a common objective, there is success.

Industry suffers from the managerial dogma that for the sake of stability and continuity, the company should be independent of the competence of individual employees. Hence industry rejects any methodological proposal that can be viewed as making intellectual demands on its work force. Since in the US the influence of industry is more pervasive than elsewhere, the above dogma hurts American computing science most. The moral of this sad part of the story is that as long as computing science is not allowed to save the computer industry, we had better see to it that the computer industry does not kill computing science.

I never took a day off in my 20s. Not one.
I never wake up today with yesterday's problems.

I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.
I realized I love motivating and I love empowering and I love inspiring people. I did that as an athlete for 18 years, and I am able to do that as a motivational speaker now as well as doing work on television.

Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.

It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
It doesn't matter how far you might rise. At some point, you are bound to stumble.... If you're constantly pushing yourself higher...the law of averages, not to mention the Myth of Icarus, predicts that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to know this, remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.

I think if there's something one needs to change with oneself, it doesn't have to happen in the New Year. You can do that any time you please - not that it's not a good inspirational tactic for the people that it works for.

I think that's a great opportunity, to pick a script where you can build up a good skill. I think the main thing I look for when I look at scripts is if it's inspirational.

I think there's an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face - that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old-time religion which, in my view, is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society.
I think there's a world market for about 5 computers.
I think the root of your mistake is saying that macros don't scale to larger groups. The real truth is that macros don't scale to stupider groups.

I want to make this world perfect.
I want to see success right away. And I want to never give up, never stop.
I want to start by, as always, thanking my family. My kids, they're not kids anymore, but they're kids as far as I'm concerned. They'll always be my kids.
I was eating in a Chinese restaurant downtown. There was a dish called Mother and Child Reunion. It's chicken and eggs. And I said, I gotta use that one.
I was motivated to be different in part because I was different.
I was obliged to be industrious. Whoever is equally industrious will succeed equally well.
I was perceived to be a first- to third-rounder. I kind of had a tough junior year and fell to the fifth round. At that time, it was motivational.
I was successful materially, but I know life is much more than worldly success. I saw all these blessings God had given me. The way to give thanks is obedience to God.
I was sure I'd set the world on fire, and it was hard for a young feller like me to realize the truth - that I hadn't set the world on fire, and I was totally unprepared to handle the consequences if 'The Big Trail' had been a success and launched me as a star.
I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work 15 and 16 hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example.
I went to a General Store, but they wouldn't sell me anything specific.
I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure.
I went to a restaurant that serves 'breakfast at any time'. So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.
I went to a restaurant that was so expensive that they didn't have prices on the menu - just little faces with varying expressions of horror.
I will always desire to play with Bruce Springsteen. He's the most inspirational, most dedicated, most committed and most focused artist I've ever seen. I like to be around people like that.
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.
I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead. Not sick, not wounded, dead.
I will offer a choice, not an echo.
I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with, all these fabulous women, 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.' I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple.
I wish I could tell you the secret to being forever young, but no one's figured that out yet. But if you see the glass half full, simplify your life, and give yourself to a worthy cause, you will be forever happy.
I wish I knew how to quit you.
I wish that the Indians believed me a god, for upon the report of an enemy's valor oftentimes depends the success of a battle, and false reports have many times done as great things as true courage and resolution.
I wish the Peace Corps and its volunteers continued success and perseverance. We are grateful for their contributions to society and dedication to providing assistance where it is needed. May the Peace Corps continue its legacy of service, both at home and abroad.
I wonder how many times people give up just before a breakthrough - when they are on the very brink of success.
I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges
I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend.
I worked at The Old Globe Theater under the great baton of Craig Noel. One of the great theater heroes that we have. He was so great and so inspirational. I think I did 'Antony and Cleopatra' and 'The Taming of the Shrew'. I lived in Ocean Beach, and my rent was $140 a month.
I worked half my life to be an overnight success, and still it took me by surprise.
I would like to wish the England squad every success. I would also very much like to extend those wishes to Martin Johnson, Brian Smith, Mike Ford, John Wells, Graham Rowntree and the rest of the England 2011 World Cup management team who have been fantastic and deserve people to know that.
I would love to be a guest on a talk show or a panel that shows women who have been on reality shows who've had success, to prove to audiences that you don't have to be a fool to become successful.
I wouldn't be human if I didn't feel pride and something that transcends pride humility.
I would probably work with Drake as he is massively inspirational to me as a writer as well as an artist. If not him, then Susan Boyle!
I would rather be able to appreciate things I can not have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.
I would rather be an optimist and be wrong than a pessimist who proves to be right. The former sometimes wins, but never the latter.
I would rather die of passion than of boredom.
I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief.
I would say I'm an inspirational guidelines book. You can take my life story or scenarios or songs and relate to them and apply them to your everyday life.
I wrote '('Til) I Kissed You' about a girl I met in Australia. Her name was Lilian, and she was very, very inspirational. I was married, but... I wrote the song about her on the way back home.
Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones. Java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since MS-DOS.
Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn't methodical, but jazz isn't messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians. Jazz is abandon.
Je crois au flooding.
Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;--love God as I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"
Joy descends gently upon us like the evening dew, and does not patter down like a hailstorm.
Joy is but the sign that creative emotion is fulfilling its purpose.
Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. She gives most who gives with Joy.
Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.
Judge me not by physical size or appearance, but judge me by the size of my character.
Judge not according to the appearance.
Judgments prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.
Just as you wouldn't leave the house without taking a shower, you shouldn't start the day without at least 10 minutes of sacred practice: prayer, meditation, inspirational reading.
Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do doesn't mean it's useless.
Just because you took longer than others, doesn't mean you failed.
Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong.
Just go out there and do what you've got to do.
Just keep going. Everybody gets better if they keep at it.
Just keep swimming.
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer... Then I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers...
Just like carpentry, measure twice cut once.
Just remember, you can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.
Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove. But I find that the whole order of Nature confirms my confidence that, if it is not like our noblest hopes and dreams, it will transcend them.
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly.

Keep all special thoughts and memories for lifetimes to come. Share these keepsakes with others to inspire hope and build from the past, which can bridge to the future.
Keep a promise.
Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.
KEEP GOING.
Keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.
Keep on going, and the chances are that you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I never heard of anyone ever stumbling on something sitting down.
Keep on keeping on.
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.
Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
Keep your fears to yourself, but share your courage with others.
Keep your feet on the ground, but let your heart soar as high as it will. Refuse to be average or to surrender to the chill of your spiritual environment.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.
Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.
Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.

Knowing and not doing are equal to not knowing at all.

Know or listen to those who know.
La connaissance d'un défaut ne l'enlève pas, elle nous torture jusqu'à sa correction.
Lady Gaga is the present and the future. She is the most revolutionary and inspirational artist. She is fearless and daring.

Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.

Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
Life is just a chance to grow a soul.
Life is less about what you do, and more about how and why you do those things. This is called character.

Life is not fair; get used to it.
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
Life isn't about getting and having, it's about giving and being.

Life's too mysterious to take too serious.
Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late.

Linux is only free if your time has no value.
LISP has been jokingly described as "the most intelligent way to misuse a computer". I think that description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

Live your life from your heart. Share from your heart. And your story will touch and heal people's souls.
Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It's part ballet. It's part battleground, part playground. We clarify, amplify and glorify the game with our footage, the narration and that music, and in the end create an inspirational piece of footage.
Look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time.
Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work.
Look at what you've got and make the best of it. It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
Look for someone's strength instead of weakness.

Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Love and desire are the spirit's wings to great deeds.
Love because it is the only true adventure.

Love never reasons but profusely gives; gives, like a thoughtless prodigal, its all, and trembles lest it has done too little.
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope.
Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries.
Love the moment. Flowers grow out of dark moments. Therefore, each moment is vital. It affects the whole. Life is a succession of such moments and to live each, is to succeed.

Luck is where opportunity meets preparation.
Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.

More power than all the success slogans ever penned by human hand is the realization for every man that he has but one boss. That boss is the man - he - himself.
More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human.

My father was an immigrant who literally walked across Europe to get out of Russia. He fought in World War I. He was wounded in action. My father was a great success even though he never had money. He was a very determined man, a great role model.
My favourite scientific theory is that the rings of Saturn are made of lost airline luggage.
My first book was called, 'Mountain, Get Out of My Way,' where I did an autobiographical sketch, if you will, looking back at myself and looking back at things in my life, and juxtaposing them against things that are happening in other people's lives and trying to be motivational.

My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I am right.
My parents are very proud of my success but still worry, as I'm in a profession where there is no guarantee of work. They have always supported my decision to go into acting, but there have been tough times work-wise.
My parents had always preached the virtues of hard work. But hard work is one thing; economic struggle is another.
My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.
My precious.
My proudest achievement has been the success of the shows and artists I have been involved with, because they were made in Britain.
My responsibility to myself, my neighbors, my family and the human family is to try to tell the truth.
My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in the fewness of my wants.
My sources are unreliable, but their information is fascinating.
My store, Wine Library, outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle. I always say that our success wasn't due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.
My success has been something I've worked a long time at and it's been a gradual process. I compare it to the idea of someone losing a lot of weight over a period of a few years. You don't really notice the weight loss overall but if you compare photos from then and now there's a big difference.
My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people.
My success isn't a result of arrogance - it's a result of belief.
My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day.
My success was due to good luck, hard work, and support and advice from friends and mentors. But most importantly, it depended on me to keep trying after I had failed.
My success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense.
My supply of brain cells is finally down to a manageable size
My tastes and inspirational artists were always rather eclectic and diverse.
My work is loving the world.

Nature, by example, shows us anything worthwhile comes over time. Anything worthwhile grows methodically, building on a strong foundation. Develop a willingness to carry on despite roadblocks.
Nature gave men two ends... one to sit on and one to think with. Ever since then man's success or failure has been dependent on the one he used most.
Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.
Neckties strangle clear thinking.
Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds.
Never allow a person to tell you no who doesn't have the power to say yes.
Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made.
Never ask a barber if he thinks you need a haircut.
Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.
Never be afraid to try something new. Remember, amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic.
Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself.
Never complain and never explain.
Never confuse motion with action.
Never continue in a job you don't enjoy. If you're happy in what you're doing, you'll like yourself, you'll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined.
Never cowardly or cruel. Never give up, never give in.
Never did a government commence under auspices so favorable, nor ever was success so complete.
Never does the human soul appear so strong and noble as when it forgoes revenge and dares to forgive injury.
Never do the impossible. People will expect you to do it forever after.
Never explain -- your Friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway.
Never give in and never give up.
Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
Never give up, never give up, never, never, never give up!
Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
Never keep up with the Joneses. Drag them down to your level. It's cheaper.
Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.
Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.
Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.
Never look down on anybody unless you're helping him up.
Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way.
Never mind what others do; do better than yourself, beat your own record from day to day, and you are a success.
Never, never, never give up.
Never preceed anything more complex than a Frisbee throw with, 'Hey boss, watch this!'
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today, and you make your tomorrow.
Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl.
Never say ""OOPS!"" always say ""Ah, Interesting!""
Never talk defeat. Use words like hope, belief, faith, victory.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
Never test the depth of the water with both feet.
Never violate the sacredness of your individual self-respect.

No amount of ability is of the slightest avail without honor.
No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.
No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Nobody can do for little children what grandparents do. Grandparents sort of sprinkle stardust over the lives of little children.
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.

Nobody knows what you feel inside unless you tell them.
Nobody's perfect.
Nobody travels on the road to success without a puncture or two.

No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again.
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
No matter how many goals you have achieved, you must set your sights on a higher one.
No matter how much success you're having, you can't continue working together if you can't communicate.
No matter how much you plan, it is tenacity, unyielding desire to succeed, and the ability to cope with change that will eventually prevail.
No matter how much you plan you're likely to get half wrong anyway. So don't do the ‘paralysis through analysis' thing. That only slows progress and saps morale.
No matter how you feel, Get up, dress up, show up and never give up.
No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.
No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.
No more duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions.
None of the secrets of success will work unless you do.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
'No one can make you successful; the will to success comes from within.' I've made this my motto. I've internalized it to the point of understanding that the success of my actions and/or endeavors doesn't depend on anyone else, and that includes a possible failure.
No one has as much luck around the greens as one who practices a lot.
No one is all evil. Everybody has a good side. If you keep waiting, it will comme up.

No one succeeds without effort... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance.
No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude.

No problem should ever have to be solved twice.

No skill shapes a child's future success in school or in life more than the ability to read.
No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.
No student ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him: it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required, that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction.
Note to self: Keep going. You're doing great. You might not be where you want to be yet, but that's okay. Just take it one step at a time and keep believing in yourself. And remember: No matter what happens, you can still enjoy your life and be happy.

Of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal.
Of all the things people have taught me regarding life lessons or anything that would benefit me, I don't think anything helped me learn more about life than football.

Of all things visible, the highest is the heaven of the fixed stars.

One day, I got so disgusted that I sat down and wrote a list called 'Justin's list of things to do before he kicks the bucket.' I wrote it for myself and shortened it to 'Justin's Bucket List.' It was there on the wall, not as a story idea but as a motivational tool for myself, which actually ended up working pretty well.

One look is worth ten thousand words.

That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.
One rarely rushes into a single error. Rushing into the first one, one always does too much. So one usually perpetrates another one--and now one does too little.

Our ideals are our better selves.
Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.
Our limitations and success will be based, most often, on your own expectations for ourselves. What the mind dwells upon, the body acts upon.
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression. It is not conquest, it is not empire, it is not foreign bases, it is not domination. It is, simply put, just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam.
Our Similarities bring us to a common ground; Our Differences allow us to be fascinated by each other.
Our soul desires to be understanding, our ego is only concerned with being understood. When you are being understanding you are connected to your soul.
Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self; their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression.

Our success educationally, industrially and politically is based upon the protection of a nation founded by ourselves. And the nation can be nowhere else but in Africa.

Patience is a remedy for every sorrow.
Patience is passion tamed.
Patience is the companion of wisdom.
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.
Patience - the gift of being able to see past the emotion.

Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!

Peace on earth will come to stay, When we live Christmas every day.

People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal.

People fall forward to success.
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.

People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing--that's why we recommend it daily.

People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life.
People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don't realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.

Thought is the wind, knowledge the sail, and mankind the vessel.

We aim above the mark to hit the mark.
We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus relax ourselves away from our fellows.
We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort.
We all have problems. The way we solve them is what makes us different.
We all learn lessons in life. Some stick, some don't. I have always learned more from rejection and failure than from acceptance and success.
We all obviously need others to look up to, and be inspirational to us. Ford did a great job as far as putting the presidency back where it belonged, getting the trust back after Nixon. And President Reagan has been one of the most influential presidents.
We all romanticize the people we adore.
We are all broken, that's how the light gets in.
We are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible situations.
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
We are all in the same boat in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a terrible loyalty.
We are born and we die. No one cares, no one remembers, and it doesn't matter. This is why we laugh.
We are constantly emphasizing to people that they need to address anything that affects flight safety or mission success - many pathways to do that. We need to understand better what may be preventing people from using those pathways.
We are each gifted in a unique and important way. It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light.
We are here to make another world.
We are limited, not by our abilities, but by our vision.
We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin.
We are not what we are, nor do we treat or esteem each other for such, but for what we are capable of being.
We are taught to consume. And that's what we do. But if we realized that there really is no reason to consume, that it's just a mind set, that it's just an addiction, then we wouldn't be out there stepping on people's hands climbing the corporate ladder of success.
We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.
We are the sum of our behaviours; excellence therefore is not an act but a habit.
We are what we believe we are.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
We ask ourselves: Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.
We become what we think about.
We become what we think about most of the time, and that's the strangest secret.
We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish.
We can come to look upon the deaths of our enemies with as much regret as we feel for those of our friends, namely, when we miss their existence as witnesses to our success.
We can do no great things - only small things with great love.

We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
We convince by our presence.
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box.
We crave instant success these days. If you are a really good sprinter and long jumper, you don't want to spend two or three years on a whole new set of events. You're used to doing well and it's difficult to give that up.
We do not admire the man of timid peace. We admire the man who embodies victorious effort; the man who never wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend, but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life.
We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work.
We do not realise that we are children of eternity. If we did, then success would be no success, and failure would be no failure to us.
We do not remember days; we remember moments.
We don't have a divine right to success. So I agree with a lot of politicians out there when they say, 'We've got serious issues.' We do: immigration, infrastructure. I think income inequality's one of them.
We don't like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.
We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.
We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.
We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.
We fall forward to succeed.
We forget that every good that is worth possessing must be paid for in strokes of daily effort. We postpone and postpone, until those smiling possibilities are dead.
We Generate Fears While We Sit. We Overcome Them By Action.
We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.
We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.

We have it in our power to begin the world over again.
We have it in our power to change the world over.
We have the finest politicians that money can buy.
We help people to begin truly healthful diets, and it is absolutely wonderful to see, not only their success, but also their delight at their ability to break old habits and feel really healthy for a change.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We just want to win. That's the bottom line. I think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success, but we don't really reflect on what we've done in the past. We focus on the present.
We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.
We know from research that growth is actually contagious, so if you want to reach your goals, you've got to get around people that are going in the same direction you want to be going, and you will catch the success.
We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.
We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.
We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.
We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success; we often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never make a mistake never made a discovery.
We live in a world of constant juxtaposition between joy that's possible and pain that's all too common. We hope for love and success and abundance, but we never quite forget that there is always lurking the possibility of disaster.
We live in the kind of society where, in almost all cases, hard work is rewarded.
We'll always have Paris.
Well, certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within 'black community' by and large.
Well done is better than well said.
Well I think any author or musician is anxious to have legitimate sales of their products, partly so they're rewarded for their success, partly so they can go on and do new things.
Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing, you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
Well, the idea is that failure is an inevitable partner on the road to success and, if you're not willing to confront failure, you can never find out how good you are.
Well, you would have to say what is the criteria to determine the success of any merger? It would have to be that the companies are stronger financially, that they took market share, and they are on a very steady footing in terms of their performance.
We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.
We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.
We must balance conspicuous consumption with conscious capitalism.
We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.
We must be very careful when we give advice to younger people: sometimes they follow it!
We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.
We must never be afraid to go too far, for success lies just beyond.
We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee.
We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal, and then leap in the dark to our success.
We need to accept that the commandments of God aren't just a long list of good ideas. They aren't 'life hacks' from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board.
We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success.
We ought to walk through the rooms of our lives not looking for flaws, but looking for potential.
We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt, that peace and abundance may manifest for all.
We reached a high point in my opinion with the passage of the civil rights legislation and Martin Luther King's success and the crusade of others. I think we kind of breathed a sigh of relief as if we had achieved the end of racial discrimination or white supremacy.
We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.
We're constantly striving for success, fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about.
We're here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.
We're in a situation where talented, motivated school leavers and graduates can send off a hundred CVs and not get a reply, and where a trip to the Job Centre is depressing rather than inspirational. And you know what, that just feels wrong.

We remember what we learn when we care about performing better and when we believe that what we have been asked to do is representative of reality.

We rise by lifting others.
We shall find peace. We shall hear angels. We shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it - and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
We shouldn't teach great books; we should teach a love of reading.
We sing inspirational songs, songs of praise and worship, and about how good and how big God is. We are magnifying the Lord.
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.
We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate causes of failure.
We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.
We've had great successes, but our future is not about our past success. It's going to be about whether we will invent things that are really going to drive our future.
We've removed the ceiling above our dreams. There are no more impossible dreams.
We've stayed really normal and down to Earth I think, and haven't let the success thing go to our head.
We were all born with a certain degree of power. The key to success is discovering this innate power and using it daily to deal with whatever challenges come our way.
We were taught to respect everyone, especially those who were older and wiser than we were from whom we could learn.
We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0.
We would often be sorry if our wishes came true.

What's on my playlist when I'm fighting is not so much hip-hop. Sometimes, it's something more inspirational. I get a chance to think about what I'm fighting for, like, my family. It takes me to that state because a lot of times, it's a spiritual warfare for me.
What's the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable.

You can do anything, but not everything.
You can do what's reasonable or you can decide what's possible.

You cannot have everything. I mean, where would you put it?
You cannot move things by not moving.
You can only grow if you're willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new.
You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity. When you get it right, it is obvious that it is right.
You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.
You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.
You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

You don't become enormously successful without encountering some really interesting problems.
You don't have to accept the invitation to get angry. Instead, practice forgiveness, empathy and encouragement.

You find beauty in ordinary things. Do not lose this ability.

You grow up the day you have your first real laugh at yourself.
You had me at hello.
You have a keen sense of humor and love a good time.
You have an unusually magnetic personality.
You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing... By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle. Heaven knows anyone's life can stand a little of that.
You have brains in your head and feet in your shoes, you can steer yourself in any direction you choose.

You know you're in love when you don't want to fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.

You learn more from failure than from success. Don't let it stop you. Failure builds character.
You'll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure.
You look at the tremendous success of Facebook. To my mind there is not a lot of commerce going on in these social networking sites. eBay is a community anchored in commerce. It is a commerce site that built a community around it. What has not been proven is if the reverse can happen and people will go to community sites to do commerce.

Young man, the secret of my success is that at early age I discovered that I was not God.

Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.
Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
Your ordinary acts of love and hope point to the extraordinary promise that every human life is of inestimable value.
Your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.
Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure.

Your vocation in life is where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest need.
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
Your work is to discover your world and then with all your heart give yourself to it.

You wear the brains in the family.
You were designed for accomplishment, engineered for success, and endowed with the seeds of greatness.
You weren't born just to live a life and to die; you were born to accomplish something specifically. Matter of fact, success is making it to the end of your purpose; that is success... Success is not just existing. Success is making it to the end of why you were born.
You will attract cultured and artistic people to your home.
You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation which 'clicks.'
