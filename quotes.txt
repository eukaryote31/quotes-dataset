About the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure.

According to the Buddha's teaching the beginning of the life-stream of living beings is unthinkable. THe believer in the creation of life by God may be astonished at this reply. But if you were to ask him 'What is the beginning of God?' he would answer without hesitation 'God has no beginning', and he is not astonished at his own reply.
Accustom yourself to the belief that death is of no concern to us, since all good and evil lie in sensation and sensation ends with death. Therefore the true belief that death is nothing to us makes a mortal life happy, not by adding to it an infinite time, but by taking away the desire for immortality. For there is no reason why the man who is thoroughly assured that there is nothing to fear in death should find anything to fear in life. So, too, he is foolish who says that he fears death, not because it will be painful when it comes, but because the anticipation of it is painful; for that which is no burden when it is present gives pain to no purpose when it is anticipated. Death, the most dreaded of evils, is therefore of no concern to us; for while we exist death is not present, and when death is present we no longer exist. It is therefore nothing either to the living or to the dead since it is not present to the living, and the dead no longer are.

Achievement is not always success, while reputed failure often is. It is honest endeavor, persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances.
Achievers have an enabling attitude, realism, and a conviction that they themselves were the laboratory of innovation. Their ability to change themselves is central to their success. They have learned to conserve their energy by minimizing the time spent in regret or complaint. Every event is a lesson to them, every person a teacher.
Achieve success in any area of life by identifying the optimum strategies and repeating them until they become habits.
A child who does not think about what happens around him and is content with living without wondering whether he lives honestly is like a man who lives from a scoundrel's work and is on the road to being a scoundrel.

A crude age. Peace is stabilized with cannon and bombers, humanity with concentration camps and pogroms. We're living in a time when all standards are turned upside-down, Kern. Today the aggressor is the shepherd of peace, and the beaten and hunted are the troublemakers of the world. What's more, there are whole races who believe it!
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
Act from reason, and failure makes you rethink and study harder. Act from faith, and failure makes you blame someone and push harder.
Acting like you don't care is not letting it go.
Action is the activity of the rational soul, which abhors irrationality and must combat it or be corrupted by it. When it sees the irrationality of others, it must seek to correct it, and can do this either by teaching or engaging in public affairs itself, correcting through its practice. And the purpose of action is to enable philosophy to continue, for if men are reduced to the material alone, they become no more than beasts.
Action is the foundational key to all success.
Action leads to Attention. that in the short-term releases Rewarding brain chemicals and in the long term improves reproductive success.

Aestheticism and radicalism must lead us to jettison reason, and to replace it by a desperate hope for political miracles. This irrational attitude which springs from intoxication with dreams of a beautiful world is what I call Romanticism. It may seek its heavenly city in the past or in the future; it may preach 'back to nature' or 'forward to a world of love and beauty'; but its appeal is always to our emotions rather than to reason. Even with the best intentions of making heaven on earth it only succeeds in making it a hell -- that hell which man alone prepares for his fellow-men.
A false-statement requires deceit and distortion for someone to buy it, but a truthful-statement sells itself.
A farm includes the passion of the farmer's heart, the interest of the farm's customers, the biological activity in the soil, the pleasantness of the air about the farm -- it's everything touching, emanating from, and supplying that piece of landscape. A farm is virtually a living organism. The tragedy of our time is that cultural philosophies and market realities are squeezing life's vitality out of most farms. And that is why the average farmer is now 60 years old. Serfdom just doesn't attract the best and brightest.
A farm regulated to production of raw commodities is not a farm at all. It is a temporary blip until the land is used up, the water polluted, the neighbors nauseated, and the air unbreathable. The farmhouse, the concrete, the machinery, and outbuildings become relics of a bygone vibrancy when another family farm moves to the city financial centers for relief.

A friend of mine said something powerful at his grandfather's funeral. He said that the greatest lesson from his grandfather's life was that he died empty, because he accomplished everything he wanted, with no regrets. I think that, along with leaving a legacy, would be the greatest sign of success.

A government for the people must depend for its success on the intelligence, the morality, the justice, and the interest of the people themselves.
A government must rule by the Grace of God or by the will of the people, it must believe in authority or in the Revolution; on these issues compromise is possible only in semblance, and only for a time. The Revolution, like the disbelief which has always accompanied it, cannot be stopped halfway; it is a force that, once awakened, will not rest until it ends in a totalitarian Kingdom of this world. The history of the last two centuries has proved nothing if not this. To appease the Revolution and offer it concessions, as Liberals have always done, thereby showing that they have no truth with which to oppose it, is perhaps to postpone, but not to prevent, the attainment of its end. And to oppose the radical Revolution with a Revolution of one's own, whether it be "conservative," " non-violent," or "spiritual," is not merely to reveal ignorance of the full scope and nature of the Revolution of our time, but to concede as well the first principle of that Revolution: that the old truth is no longer true, and a new truth must take its place.
A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.
A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that 'individuality' is the key to success.
A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.

A great tree develops over time and can tell stories not only those of happiness, but also those that contain pain from what it has seen over the years, and as a result is the wise ancient tree that it is today. As the seasons change, the tree naturally goes through changes as well: where the leaves turn yellow and orange in the fall, falling by the Winter, returning in the Spring, and with full set of new leafs by the Summer. Love is no different in that there will be times when we are fully naked in the Winter, and left to wonder about Spring when it seemed so easy to love, yet the wise tree knows that no winter will last forever no matter how cold it may be.

A human being has so many skins inside, covering the depths of the heart. We know so many things, but we don't know ourselves! Why, thirty or forty skins or hides, as thick and hard as an ox's or bear's, cover the soul. Go into your own ground and learn to know yourself there.
A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

Almost every college playwright or sketch or improv comedian was sort of aware of Christopher Durang - even kids in high school. His short plays were so accessible to younger people and I think that was inspirational to me.

Although her disobedience is tragic, Eve's innocence is not all bad. Certainly, that innocfence leads her to make a poor choice - the very worst - but the fact that she makes a choice at all, the fact that she engages the Devil in a debate which could go either way, the fact that she acts without God breathing down her neck - all speak for her free will or, what amounts to the same thing, her margin for error. It is from this margin for error that freedom springs, because you can't be free to right unless you can be free to be wrong.
Although he's no longer with us, Steve Jobs is still inspirational to me, as he managed to find the balance between right brain/left-brain thinking that is crucial to building a creative technology business.
Although we had had no precise exponents of realism, yet after Pushkin it was impossible for a Russian writer to depart too far from actuality. Even those who did not know what to do with "real life" had to cope with it as best they could. Hence, in order that the picture of life should not prove too depressing, the writer must provide himself in due season with a philosophy.
although we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to determine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight presents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined to the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the conclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason that what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly tells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth.
Although you may not stumble across a Martian in the garden, you might stumble across yourself. The day that happens, you'll probably also scream a little. And that'll be perfectly all right, because it's not every day you realize you're a living planet dweller on a little island in the universe.
Always ask the questions you want to, life is too short to know if you'll get a second chance to ask , and afterlife is probably too long to wonder what the answer may be.
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other one thing.

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
Always concentrate on how far you've come, rather than how far you have left to go.
Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do whatever you choose, if you first get to know who you are and are willing to work with a power that is greater than ourselves to do it.
Always desire to learn something useful.
Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.
Always fall in with what you're asked to accept. Take what is given, and make it over your way. My aim in life has always been to hold my own with whatever's going. Not against: with.
Always forgive, but never forget, else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred, and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever.
Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much.
Always give your best, never get discouraged, never be petty; always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.

A manager is a guide. He takes a group of people and says, 'With you I can make us a success; I can show you the way.'
A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.
A man could be a lover and defender of the wilderness without ever in his lifetime leaving the boundaries of asphalt, powerlines, and right-angled surfaces. We need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it. We need a refuge even though we may never need to set foot in it. We need the possibility of escape as surely as we need hope; without it the life of the cities would drive all men into crime or drugs or psychoanalysis.
A man has to learn that he cannot command things, but that he can command himself; that he cannot coerce the wills of others, but that he can mold and master his own will: and things serve him who serves Truth; people seek guidance of him who is master of himself.
A man knows he has found his vocation when he stops thinking about how to live, and begins to live.

A man who is not eager to help others has no chance to be a success.
A man who lacks reliability is utterly useless.
A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive.
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.
America's abundance was created not by public sacrifices to the common good, but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes. They did not starve the people to pay for America's industrialization. They gave the people better jobs, higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every scientific discovery or technological advance- and thus the whole country was moving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.
America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.
America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.

A miracle is often the willingness to see the common in an uncommon way.
Am I right in suggesting that ordinary life is a mean between these extremes, that the noble man devotes his material wealth to lofty ends, the advancement of science, or art, or some such true ideal; and that the base man does the opposite by concentrating all his abilities on the amassing of wealth?'
A mistake is a crash-course in learning.
A modern philosopher who has never once suspected himself of being a charlatan must be such a shallow mind that his work is probably not worth reading.
A moment of patience in a moment of anger can help us avoid a thousand moments of sorrow.
Among peoples who possess a highly developed pugnacious instinct we find the greatest progress in the arts, sciences, social and political organization, commerce and industry. The instinct takes the milder form of rivalry which is the motive force of the great portion of the serious labors of mankind.
Among the things you can give and still keep are your word, a smile, and a grateful heart.

An age cannot bind itself and ordain to put the succeeding one into such a condition that it cannot extend its (at best very occasional) knowledge , purify itself of errors, and progress in general enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature, the proper destination of which lies precisely in this progress and the descendants would be fully justified in rejecting those decrees as having been made in an unwarranted and malicious manner.
An American has not seen the United States until he has seen Mardi-Gras in New Orleans.
An ancient burial site will always hold clues as to who the people were, and to who we are.
An animal can't think like we do, but then again, neither can we!
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.' But eating too many, is quite enough-plenty. And you'll have to go see the good doc anyway.
An appreciation of what you have brings the ultimate abundance in your life.
An artist cannot fail; it is a success to be one.
An artist must never be a prisoner. Prisoner? An artist should never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of style, prisoner of reputation, prisoner of success, etc.
A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at five or six great men- yes, and then to get around them.
A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great men.--Yes, and then to get round them.
An attempt to achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picture gallery at the price of cutting out his eyes.
And above all things, never think that you're not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning.
...and after discarding the emptiness of the Big Congested Mess, we discover the fullness of Nothing.
And although I have seen nothing but black crows in my life, it doesn't mean that there's no such thing as a white crow. Both for a philosopher and for a scientist it can be important not to reject the possibility of finding a white crow. You might almost say that hunting for 'the white crow' is science's principal task.
And don't tell me the end justifies the means because it doesn't. We never reach the end. All we ever get is means. That's what we live with.
And, drunk with my own madness, I shouted at him furiously, "Make life beautiful! Make life beautiful!
And if one loves me for my judgement, memory, he does not love
And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
And in the end it's not the years in your life that count; it's the life in your years.
And last are the few whose delight is in meditation and understanding; who yearn not for goods, nor for victory, but for knowledge; who leave both market and battlefield to lose themselves in the quiet clarity of secluded thought; whose will is a light rather than a fire, whose haven is not power but truth: these are the men of wisdom, who stand aside unused by the world.
And merely looking at you, I confessed my love in a million ways.
And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. This god, this one word: 'I.
And now, this is the sweetest and most glorious day that ever my eyes did see.
And now we step to the rhythm of miracles.
And one thing we know is real: horror. It is so real, in fact, that we cannot be sure it could not exist without us. Yes, it needs our imaginations and our consciousness, but it does not ask or require our consent to use them. Indeed, horror operates with complete autonomy. Generating ontological havoc, it is mephitic foam upon which our lives merely float. And, all said, we must face up to it: horror is more real than we are.
And still the text will remain, if it is really cryptic and parodying (and I tell you that it is so through and through. I might as well tell you since it won't be of any help to you. Even my admission can very well be a lie because there is dissimulation only if one tells the truth, only if one tells that one is telling the truth), still the text will remain indefinitely open, cryptic and parodying.
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.
And this is the forbidden truth, the unspeakable taboo - that evil is not always repellent but frequently attractive; that it has the power to make of us not simply victims, as nature and accident do, but active accomplices.
And to awaken me She comes every night in my dream and kisses me.
And when I breathed, my breath was lightning.
And you don't even need to say anything. I'm screwed up. I don't know how any of this works anymore than you do. But I do believe you're worth every second it would take to figure it out," Mason said, a smile taking over his features.
A neat desk is a sign of a cluttered desk drawer.
A neat desk is the sign of a sick mind.
An empowered organisation is one in which individuals have the knowledge, skill, desire, and opportunity to personally succeed in a way that leads to collective organisational success.
An error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.
A new day always comes with new hopes, new opportunities, and new lives.
A new study shows that licking the sweat off a frog can cure depression. The down side is, the minute you stop licking, the frog gets depressed again.
An expert is, according to my working definition "someone who doesn't need to look up answers to easy questions".
An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.
Anger is a mask that tries to hide inner weakness.
Angka dua untuk daya yang dikenal sebagai Yin dan Yang - setara dan berlawanan; mereka menyatukan alam semesta ini bersama-sama (Putri Yangxin-Garden of The Purple Dragon)
An honest answer is the sign of true friendship.
An honest religious thinker is like a tightrope walker. He almost looks as though he were walking on nothing but air. His support is the slenderest imaginable. And yet it really is possible to walk on it.
A nice cake is waiting for you.
An ignorant person is inclined to blame others for his own misfortune. To blame oneself is proof of progress. But the wise man never has to blame another or himself.
Animals are irrational men
An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. "Can they be brought together?" This is a practical question. We must get down to it. "I despise intelligence" really means: "I cannot bear my doubts.
An intelligent man is one who acknowledges his intelligence as that of those who surround him.
An interpreter raises the machine to the level of the user program; a compiler lowers the user program to the level of the machine language.

A non negative binary integer value x is a power of 2 if (x & (x-1)) is 0 using 2's complement arithmetic.
...an optimistic mind-set finds dozens of possible solutions for every problem that the pessimist regards as incurable.
An optimist stays up until midnight to see the new year in. A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves.
An ordinary mirror is silvered at the back but the window of the night train has darkness behind the glass. My face and the faces of other travellers were now mirrored on this darkness in a succession of stillnesses. Consider this, said the darkness: any motion at any speed is a succession of stillnesses; any section through an action will show just such a plane of stillness as this dark window in which your seeking face is mirrored. And in each plane of stillness is the moment of clarity that makes you responsible for what you do.
An ounce of gold cannot buy an ounce of time.
An ounce of mother is worth a pound of clergy.
An ounce of practice is better than tons of teaching.
A no uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a yes merely uttered to please or what is worse, to avoid trouble.
A novel is never anything but a philosophy expressed in images. And in a good novel the philosophy has disappeared into the images.
An over examination of life can deter you from life itself
Anticipation is the key to success.
An unexamined life is not worth living.
Anybody who succeeds is helping people. The secret to success is find a need and fill it; find a hurt and heal it; find a problem and solve it.
Any change, even a change for the better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts.
Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.
Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.
Any fool can make the simple complex, only a smart person can make the complex simple.
Any fool can see the limits of seeing, but not even the wisest know the limits of knowing. Thus is ignorance rendered invisible, and are all Men made fools.
Any game where the goal is to build territory has to be beautiful. There may be phases of combat, but they are only means to an end, to allow your territory to survive. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the game of go is that it has been proven that in order to win, you must live, but you must also allow the other player to live. Players who are too greedy will lose: it is a subtle game of equilibrium, where you have to get ahead without crushing the other player. In the end, life and death are only the consequences of how well or how poorly you have made your construction. This is what one of Taniguchi's characters says: you live, you die, these are consequences. It's a proverb for playing go, and for life.
Any man worth his salt will stick up for what he believes right, but it takes a slightly better man to acknowledge instantly and without reservation that he is in error.
Anyone can dabble, but once you've made that commitment, your blood has that particular thing in it, and it's very hard for people to stop you.
Anyone can exist. Most fools do. It takes guts to truly Live.
Anyone who fights for the future, lives in it today.
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.
Anyone who isn't confused really doesn't understand the situation.
Any person who, with all the sincerity of heart, is in search for God, on land or in the sea, is worthy of respect.
Any philosophy, whether of a religious or political nature - and sometimes the dividing line is hard to determine - fights less for the negative destruction of the opposing ideology than for the positive promotion of its own. Hence its struggle is less defensive than offensive. It therefore has the advantage even in determining the goal, since this goal represents the victory of its own idea, while, conversely,it is hard to determine when the negative aim of the destruction of a hostile doctrine may be regarded as achieved and assured. For this reason alone, the philosophy's offensive will be more systematic and also more powerful than the defensive against a philosophy, since here, too, as always, the attack and not the defence makes the decision. The fight against a spiritual power with methods of violence remains defensive, however, until the sword becomes the support,the herald and disseminator, of a new spiritual doctrine.
[A]ny species that exempts itself from the rules of competition ends up destroying the community in order to support its own expansion.
Any sufficiently advanced technology is undistinguishable from magic.
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.
Anything free is worth the price.
Anything in life worth having is worth working for.
Anything not nailed down is mine. Anything I can pry loose is not nailed down.
Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.
Anything worth taking seriously is worth making fun of.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
Any war that requires the suspension of reason as a necessity for support is a bad war.
A painting is more than the sum of its parts,' he would tell me, and then go on to explain how the cow by itself is just a cow, and the meadow by itself is just grass and flowers, and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light, but put them all together and you've got magic.
Apakah seorang pencari keheningan adalah si mulia? ataukah si pengecut yang tidak berani menghadapi masalah dunia?
A Paradox, the doughnut hole. Empty space, once, but now they've learned to market even that. A minus quantity; nothing, rendered edible. I wondered if they might be used-metaphorically, of course-to demonstrate the existence of God. Does naming a sphere of nothingness transmute it into being?
A paranoid is someone who knows a little of what's going on.
A part of us remains wherever we have been.
A passionate belief in your business and personal objectives can make all the difference between success and failure. If you aren't proud of what you're doing, why should anybody else be?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
A penny saved is not worth much, honestly.
A person is not given integrity. It results from the relentless pursuit of honesty at all times.
A person who has not been completely alienated, who has remained sensitive and able to feel, who has not lost the sense of dignity, who is not yet "for sale", who can still suffer over the suffering of others, who has not acquired fully the having mode of existence - briefly, a person who has remained a person and not become a thing - cannot help feeling lonely, powerless, isolated in present-day society. He cannot help doubting himself and his own convictions, if not his sanity. He cannot help suffering, even though he can experience moments of joy and clarity that are absent in the life of his "normal" contemporaries. Not rarely will he suffer from neurosis that results from the situation of a sane man living in an insane society, rather than that of the more conventional neurosis of a sick man trying to adapt himself to a sick society. In the process of going further in his analysis, i.e. of growing to greater independence and productivity,his neurotic symptoms will cure themselves.
A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
A person who won't read has no advantage over one who can't read.
A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties.
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
A philosopher is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there. A theologian is the man who finds it.
A philosopher is a lover of wisdom, not of knowledge, which for all its great uses ultimately suffers from the crippling effect of ephemerality. All knowledge is transient linked to the world around it and subject to change as the world changes, whereas wisdom, true wisdom is eternal immutable. To be philosophical one must love wisdom for its own sake, accept its permanent validity and yet its perpetual irrelevance. It is the fate of the wise to understand the process of history and yet never to shape it.
A philosopher knows that in reality he knows very little. That is why he constantly strives to achieve true insight. Socrates was one of these rare people. He knew that he knew nothing about life and about the world. And now comes the important part: it troubled him that he knew so little.
A philosopher named Aristippus, who had quite willingly sucked up to Dionysus and won himself a spot at his court, saw Diogenes cooking lentils for a meal. "If you would only learn to compliment Dionysus, you wouldn't have to live on lentils."
A philosophical thought is not supposed to be impervious to all criticism; this is the error Whitehead describes of turning philosophy into geometry, and it is useful primarily as a way of gaining short-term triumphs in personal arguments that no one else cares (or even knows) about anyway. A good philosophical thought will always be subject to criticisms (as Heidegger's or Whitehead's best insights all are) but they are of such elegance and depth that they change the terms of debate, and function as a sort of "obligatory passage point" (Latour's term) in the discussions that follow.
A philosophy professor at my college, whose baby became enamored of the portrait of David Hume on a Penguin paperback, had the cover laminated in plastic so her daughter could cut her teeth on the great thinker.
A photograph shouldn't be just a picture, it should be a philosophy.
A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.
A piece of art comes to life, when we can feel, it is breathing, when it talks to us and starts raising questions. It may dispel biased perceptions; make us recognize ignored fragments and remember forsaken episodes of our life story. Art may sometimes even be nasty and disturbing, if we don't want to consent to its philosophy or concept, but it might, in the end, perhaps reconcile us with ourselves. ("When is Art?")
A place for everything, everything in its place.
Apocalypse is a frame of mind." [Nicodemus] said then. "A belief. A surrender to inevitability. It is a despair for the future. It is the death of hope.
A poet is intensely in love with live and passionately wants to express his or her experience with love and beauty.
A poet is not an apostle; he drives out devils only by the power of the devil.
A poet or philosopher should have no fault to find with his age if it only permits him to do his work undisturbed in his own corner; nor with his fate if the corner granted him allows of his following his vocation without having to think about other people.
A positive attitude will not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort.
A positive person discusses possibilities. A negative person discusses problems. A cynic is oblivious to positivity and negativity.
Applause waits on success.
A preoccupation with the next world clearly shows an inability to cope credibly with this one.
A present is a friend you give yourself.
A prime candidate for natural deselection.
A prison becomes a home when you have the key.
A prudent man should always follow in the path trodden by great men and imitate those who are most excellent, so that if he does not attain to their greatness, at any rate he will get some tinge of it.
A quiet evening with friends is the best tonic for a long day.
Architecture is not an inspirational business, it's a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things; that's all.
A real entrepreneur is somebody who has no safety net underneath them.
A rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success.
Are you genuine? Or merely an actor? A representative? Or that which is represented? In the end, perhaps you are merely a copy of an actor. Second question of conscience.
Are you not ashamed of caring so much for the making of money and for fame and prestige, when you neither think nor care about wisdom and truth and the improvement of your soul?
Are you one who looks on? Or one who lends a hand? Or one who looks away and walks off? Third question of conscience.
Are you willing to wear your white belt?
Argo f=E2=80=94 yourself.
Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot. If you compete with slaves you become a slave.
Aristotle may be regarded as the cultural barometer of Western history. Whenever his influence dominated the scene, it paved the way for one of history's brilliant eras; whenever it fell, so did mankind.
A river cuts through a rock not because of its power but its persistence.
A robot will never appreciate the beauty of a sunrise or sunset.
Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything becomes--what? perhaps a "world"?
Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another.
Artificial Intelligence is just the alien inside of us.
Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
Art is the social antithesis of society, not directly deducible from it.
Art is whatever you can get away with.
Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
As a computer, I find your faith in technology amusing.
As a man, casting off worn out garments taketh new ones, so the dweller in the body, entereth into ones that are new.
As an actor there's a lot of scrutiny and, even when you've had success, it becomes about sustaining that success. A friend of mine described it as a peakless mountain. Even for De Niro there's Pacino and for Pacino there's De Niro.
As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.
As a rule, we don't like to feel to sad or lonely or depressed. So why do we like music (or books or movies) that evoke in us those same negative emotions? Why do we choose to experience in art the very feelings we avoid in real life?
As builders and creators finding the perfect solution should not be our main goal. We should find the perfect problem.
A scam is only a scam when it is discovered by the gullible that were taken in by the lure of making easy money in the first place.
A scientist may not be sure of the answer, but he's often sure he can find one. And that's a condition which is clearly not enjoyed by philosophy.
As Darwin discovered, competition is important for the survival of our species. It may not be the competition with others but the competition within ourselves.
A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.
A sentence is something you should never put a preposition at the end of.
A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.
As far as I am concerned, philosophic questioning is just as likely to make you confused and depressed as it is to improve your condition.
As for courage and will we cannot measure how much of each lies within us, we can only trust there will be sufficient to carry through trials which may lie ahead.
As for Doing-good,
As for the future, your task is not to foresee it but to enable it.
A shepherd has always need of a bell-wether--or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.
A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.
A ship in the harbor is safe. But that's not what ships are for.
As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world, that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves.
As if!
...as I get older, I find myself insisting on my right to be philosophically sloppy.
A signature always reveals a man's character - and sometimes even his name.
A sign of a lover of wisdom is his delight in not running his mouth about things he doesn't know.
A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally, therefore, a will to stupidity.
As I naturally go through a full range of emotions in my life, I mustn't feel ashamed for feeling lost, for it is honest and human to feel such.
As individuals express their life, so they are.
A sine curve goes off to infinity, or at least to the end of the blackboard.
A sin is nothing more than regret. Not for doing it once, but doing it again when you know you're going to regret it.
A sister is a dearest friend, a closest enemy, and an angel at the time of need.
As I've progressed in my career, I've come to appreciate - and really value - the other attributes that define a company's success beyond the P&L: great leadership, long-term financial strength, ethical business practices, evolving business strategies, sound governance, powerful brands, values-based decision-making.
Ask advice, but use your own common sense.
Ask and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.
As kids we're not taught how to deal with success; we're taught how to deal with failure. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. If at first you succeed, then what?
Ask me about my vow of silence.
As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.
As life in general constituted much pain in the form of struggles against poverty, disease, ignorance, and emotional anguish, what more civilized way for people to alleviate the same than by giving themselves to one another as brothers and sisters in deed as well as in word? A society of people hoping to become politically superior needed first to become spiritually valid.
A slipping gear could let your M203 grenade launcher fire when you least expect it. That would make you quite unpopular in what's left of your unit.
As long as a man had the courage to reject what society told him to do, he could live life on his own terms. To what end? To be free. But free to what end? To read books, to write books, to think.
As long as I'm not selling out the people that ride or die with me, I'm glad I'm not an MC. I'm a motivational speaker. I'm not that rapper dude.
As long as one believes in philosophy, one is healthy; sickness begins when one starts to think.
As long as there is institutional inequality, hell, naw we can't all get along!
As long as we are children, we have the ability to experience things around us--but then we grow used to the world. To grow up is to get drunk on sensory experience.
As long as your ideas of what's possible are limited by what's actual, no other idea has a chance.
As long as you think your past is bad you must be improving.
As machines learn they will do the one thing that man hasn't.
As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer to his neighbor?
A smile can take you anywhere in life.
A smile is a girl's essential item, and a man's weakness.
A smile is the beginning of peace.
A smile is the universal welcome.
A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around.
A smile's warmth comes from the fire within the heart.
A smiling lie is a whirlwind, easy to enter, but hard to escape.
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.
As my family story shows, Latinos have been a blessing for USA for many generations. The future of America depends in part on the success of the Latino community, and this opportunity is just one more signifier of that.
As my father used to tell me, the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy.
A somebody was once a nobody who wanted to and did.
A soul that is kind and intends justice discovers more than any sophist.
A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love, betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.

As soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples.
as soon as we renounce fiction and illusion, we lose reality itself; the moment we subtract fictions from reality, reality itself loses its discursive-logical consistency.
As soon as you have made a thought, laugh at it.
Assumption is the mother of all screw-ups.
As the builders say, the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser.
As the nights get colder, the hugs get warmer.
A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
Astonishment is the root of philosophy.
A strong cup of tea ails many woes.
A strong passion for any object will ensure success, for the desire of the end will point out the means.
A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success.

A sure cure for seasickness is to sit under a tree.
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.
As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.
As we raise our national flag do we also raise our hatred and ignorance?
As you become more clear about who you really are, you'll be better able to decide what is best for you - the first time around.
As you start your journey, the first thing you should do is throw away that store-bought map and begin to draw your own.
As you walk in God's divine wisdom, you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life.
A tail call allows a function to return the result of another function without leaving an entry on the stack. Tail recursion is a specific case of tail calling.
At any given moment, you have the power to say: This is not how the story is going to end.
A tense table will never be able to hold the English crockery that is placed upon it.
A text is not a text unless it hides from the first comer, from the first glance, the law of its composition and the rules of its game. A text remains, moreover, forever imperceptible. Its laws and rules are not, however, harbored in the inaccessibility of a secret; it is simply that they can never be booked, in the present, into anything that could rigorously be called a perception.
Atheism is a non-prophet organisation.
Atheism is a way of humility. It's to think oneself to be an animal, as we are actually and to allow oneself to become human.
Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious. In fact, 'atheism' is a term that should not even exist. No one needs to identify himself as a 'non-astrologer' or a 'non-alchemist.' We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.
A thing is only as great as the amount a person is willing to risk for it. If you are not willing to risk anything, then the thing mustn't be so great at all.
A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God mean who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to be concerned about thyself! become objective!"--And Socrates?--And the "scientific man"?
At his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and justice he is the worst.
A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which a man can aspire.
A toast, Jedediah, to love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows - his own.
At Princeton I gained a great deal of pleasure from success in my classes. knowing that I could accomplish those things, and I realized that my success was directly proportionate to the work I put in.
A tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the chief reason for which we sought it has passed away.
A tree may fall in the forest , but still never reach the ground.
A true confession: I believe in a soluble fish.
A true friend freely, advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, and continues a friend unchangeably.
A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success!
A true hero is not someone who thinks about doing what is right, but one that simply does what is right without thinking!
A true philosopher must never give up.
A truly rich man is one whose children run into his arms when his hands are empty.
A truth is not necessary, because we negatively are not able to conceive the actual existence of the opposite thereof;but a truth is necessary when we positively are able to apprehend that the negation thereof includes an inevitable contradiction. It is not that that we can see how the opposite comes to be true, but it is that the opposite can not possibly be true.
A truth that's told with bad intent
At sunrise everything is luminous but not clear.
At the age of 18, I made up my mind to never have another bad day in my life. I dove into a endless sea of gratitude from which I've never emerged.
At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a child's success is the positive involvement of parents.
At the end of the day, the one commonality that both Hindi cinema and Hollywood share is that they are full of talented and inspirational people. Outside of this, there are many differences, from the scheduling and rehearsal to promotion and directing techniques.
At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure. And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful. As long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be, you will always be a failure.
At the heart of nature's mystery lies another mystery.
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities.
At the time this is written the testing has not yet been completed, but the resulting system is guaranteed to be flawless
At the very best, a mind enclosed in language is in prison. It is limited to the number of relations which words can make simultaneously present to it; and remains in ignorance of thoughts which involve the combination of a greater number. These thoughts are outside language, they are unformulable, although they are perfectly rigorous and clear and although every one of the relations they involve is capable of precise expression in words. So the mind moves in a closed space of partial truth, which may be larger or smaller, without ever being able so much as to glance at what is outside.
At this point we can finally see what's really at stake in our peculiar habit of defining ourselves simultaneously as master and slave, reduplicating the most brutal aspects of the ancient household in our very concept of ourselves, as masters of our freedoms, or as owners of our very selves. It is the only way that we can imagine ourselves as completely isolated beings. There is a direct line from the new Roman conception of liberty -- not as the ability to form mutual relationships with others, but as the kind of absolute power of "use and abuse" over the conquered chattel who make up the bulk of a wealthy Roman man's household -- to the strange fantasies of liberal philosophers like Hobbes, Locke, and Smith, about the origins of human society in some collection of thirty- or forty-year-old males who seem to have sprung from the earth fully formed, then have to decide whether to kill each other or begin to swap beaver pelts.
Attitude is no substitute for competence.
Avoid crawfish.
Awards are not the only markers of success; I don't judge myself just based on them. I believe that each cinema-goer has his own mental trophies.
A well directed imagination is the source of great deeds.
A will finds a way.
A winner makes commitments. A loser makes promises.
A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.
A wise man makes his own decisions; an ignorant man follows public opinion.
A witty saying proves nothing.
Awkward silences rule the world. People are so terrified of awkward silences that they will literally go to war rather than face an awkward silence.
A woman has to live her life, or live to repent not having lived it.
A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
A work well begun is half-ended.
A world without poetry and art would be too much like one without birds or flowers: bearable but a lot less enjoyable.
A writer always writes.
A writer is one who communicates ideas and emotions people want to communicate but aren't quite sure how, or even if, they should communicate them.
A year from now you may wish you had started today.
A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!
Barack Obama likes to point to General Motors as the poster child for the job creation success of his economic policies. However, whatever your sentiments about the government's bailout of General Motors, for every job Barack Obama 'saved-or-created' in the U.S. there were two jobs off shore.
Barack Obama's inspirational whoosh to the presidency in 2008 was unusual. Most campaigns are less exhilarating; indeed, they are downright disappointing - until someone wins.
Baseless victimhood is usually the last stage before outright aggression.
Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you.
Be a good listener. Your ears will never get you in trouble.
Be a life long or short, its completeness depends on what it was lived for.
Be a surfer. Watch the ocean. Figure out where the big waves are breaking and adjust accordingly.
Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every new year find you a better man.
Beauty as we feel it is something indescribable; what it is or what it means can never be said.
Beauty is an experience, nothing else. It is not a fixed pattern or an arrangement of features. It is something felt, a glow or a communicated sense of fineness.
Beauty is an expression of the inner and outer simplicity, kindness, and uniqueness of a person.
Beauty is not who you are on the outside, it is the wisdom and time you gave away to save another struggling soul like you.
Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes right to the bone
Be awesome! Let your mind dance like a butterfly and your heart sing like a flower.
Be a worthy worker and work will come.
Be better than you were yesterday.
Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative place where no one else has ever been.
Be careful of your actions. You never know when your creating a memory.
... because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include all things in your gratitude.
Because each of you has his or her own death, you carry it with you in a secret place from the moment you're born, it belongs to you and you belong to it.
Because it's much more pleasant to be obsessed over how the hero gets out of his predicament than it is over how I get out of mine.
Because life is a living, breathing work of art, you are a painting as you go. Be a masterpiece. Drink in life. Laugh too loud. Compliment others constantly.
Because of your smile, you make life more beautiful.
Because philosophy arises from awe, a philosopher is bound in his way to be a lover of myths and poetic fables. Poets and philosophers are alike in being big with wonder.
Because there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.
Because this is another thing your average American man in crisis does: he tries to go home, forgetting, momentarily, that he is the reason he left home in the first place, that the home is not his anymore, and that the crisis is him.
Because we have for millenia made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world, looked upon it with blind desire, passion or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually become so marvelously variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has acquired color - but we have been the colorists: it is the human intellect that has made appearances appear and transported its erroneous basic conceptions into things.
Be confident to be competent.
Be courageous enough to be kind.

Be fearless and write the fairytale of your life.

Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.
Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.
Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success.
Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.
Before man ventures into daydreams about his futuristic society, he should
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
Before someone's tomorrow has been taken away, cherish those you love, appreciate them today.
Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do.
Before this moment, I have never whished to be something other than what I am.
Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.
Before you can become a millionaire, you must learn to think like one. You must learn how to motivate yourself to counter fear with courage. Making critical decisions about your career, business, investments and other resources conjures up fear, fear that is part of the process of becoming a financial success.
Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away, and you have their shoes
Before you hate something you should try to understand it.
be formless, shapeless - like water.
Be gentle to all and stern with yourself.
Begin, be bold, and venture to be wise.
Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand-and melting like a snowflake.
Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.
Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined. Society has but little connection with such beginnings. The worm is in man's heart. That is where it must be sought. One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.
Begin somewhere; you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do.
Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.
Behold the turtle. He only makes progress when he sticks his neck out.
Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.
Being able to touch so many people through my businesses, and make money while doing it, is a huge blessing.
Being an optimist after you've got the very thing you want doesn't count.
Being established in my life, buttressed by my thinking nature, fastened down in this transcendental field which was opened for me by my first perception, and in which all absence is merely the obverse of a presence, all silence a modality of the being of sound, I enjoy a sort of ubiquity and theoretical eternity, I feel destined to move in a flow of endless life, neither the beginning nor the end of which I can experience in thought, since it is my living self who think of them, and since thus my life always precedes and survives itself.
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.
Being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness.
Being kind is the most important thing I've ever been taught. That's what my parents always told me - more important than ambition or success is being kind to people. The cornerstone of my life. What I aspire to is to be kind.
Being rich of heart makes you wealthy beyond compare.
Being right is highly overrated. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
Be in limits, life will never limit you.
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.
Be kind. It will reveal your true inner beauty.
Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
Belief creates the actual fact.
Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.
belief is the death of intelligence.
Believe in human beings - not all are good, but deep down all can be. But that doesn't mean you need to hang around crappy people and try to turn them around.
Believe in the wonderment of life, the magic of love, and the reality of death.
Believe in your dreams and dream big. And then after you've done that, dream bigger.
Believe in your dreams and they may come true; believe in yourself and they will come true.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
Believe me if you consult philosophy she will persuade you not to lit so long at your counting desk
Believe me there is no such thing as great suffering, great regret, great memory....everything is forgotten, even a great love. That's what's sad about life, and also what's wonderful about it. There is only a way of looking at things, a way that comes to you every once in a while. That's why it's good to have had love in your life after all, to have had an unhappy passion- it gives you an alibi for the vague despairs we all suffer from.
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
Believe that you can do it cause you can do it.
Believe those who seek the truth; doubt those that find it.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Be like a postage stamp. Stick to it until you get there.
Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.
Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone one who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.
Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

Ben, if you get pee in my brand-new car, I am going to cut your balls off."
Be not be vulnerable, be unstoppable.
Be not entangled in this world of days and nights; Thou hast another time and space as well.
Be passionate and bold. Always keep learning. You stop doing useful things if you don't learn. So the last part to me is the key, especially if you have had some initial success. It becomes even more critical that you have the learning 'bit' always switched on.
Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure, there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together, and if you're really working, you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.
Besides our eyes, skin and the other senses through which we receive the shadows of the exterior reality, we have a 'mental eye' (intelligence) with which we can perceive reality as it is.
Be soft, sweet, kind, and wild to be wonderful.
Be so good they can't ignore you.
Be stubborn about your goals, and flexible about your methods.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Be the kind of person that you want people to think you are.
Be the kind of person who catches the shit before it hits the fan, not the one who scrapes it off afterwards.
Be the light. Let others see their beauty of being in your light.
Be the reason someone smiles today.
Be thine own palace, or the world's thy jail.
Better keep yourself clean and bright. You are the window through which you must see the world.
Better to be called something positive and inspirational than something negative.
Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.
Between living and dreaming there is a third thing. Guess it.
Between natural ability and education choose natural ability, as it will keep you happy and will fetch you the glory sooner.
Be unusual, be strange, and be phenomenal.
Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.
Be who you are, and do what you think is right.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.
Be willing to have it so. Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.
Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
Beyond all sciences, philosophies, theologies, and histories, a child's relentless inquiry is truly all it takes to remind us that we don't know as much as we think we know.
Beyond the fiction of reality, there is the reality of the fiction.
Be your own master and control yourself. You will find that everything is under control.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Be yourself. Follow your instincts. Success depends, at least in part, on the ability to 'carry it off.'
Be yourself. There is something that you can do better than any other. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that.
Big Brother is watching you.
Big journeys begin with a single step.
Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
Bitcoin has a tremendous 'network effect', in my opinion, which may give it an insurmountable early-mover advantage. In technology it is often not the best technology that "wins", but the one that achieves broad enough adoption and recognition early enough. Good enough beats best if deployed broadly.
Bitcoin is at the same stage as the Internet in 1992-1993. At that time, it took UNIX command-line skills to send email. No way near ready for mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin is created electronically and exchanged between users without passing by a financial intermediary.
Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits the power of the long tail.
BLACK AND WHITE
Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love.
Blockchain is the tech. Bitcoin is merely the first mainstream manifestation of its potential.
Blood, Sweat and Respect. First Two You Give, Last One You Earn.
Bloom as if you want to make the whole world beautiful.
Bloom where you are planted.
Bodies are real entities. Surfaces and lines are but fictitious entities. A surface without depth, a line without thickness, was never seen by any man; no; nor can any conception be seriously formed of its existence.
Bodybuilding is an art, your body is the canvas, weights are your brush and nutrition is your paint. We all have the ability to turn a self-portrait into a masterpiece.
Body is a home, a prison and a grave.
Bond. James Bond.
Books are challenging and inspirational to me.
Books can be immensely powerful. The ideas in them can change the way people think. Yet it was the Nazis and Stalin's officers who committed terrible crimes, and not Mein Kampf or the Communist Manifesto - and of course, the Manifesto contained many key ideas that are still relevant and important today, long after Stalin has gone. There is a crucial distinction between the book and its effect - it's crucial because if you talk about a book being harmful rather than its effect you begin to legitimise censorship. Abhorrent ideas need to be challenged by better ones, not banned.
Boomerangs are coming back, Ski slopes are going downhill, but Exit signs are on the way out.
Both Bratva and thieves in law would like to call themselves nihilists and anarchists because they don't support the established government, but they govern nonetheless, and you can't be an anarchist unless you follow its rule. Crime and anarchy are no more synonymous than nihilism and existentialism, or fatalism and determinism; so many isms there was bound to be a schism.
Both my mother and I were determined that we weren't going to stay on welfare. We always worked toward doing better, toward having a better life. We never had any doubts that we would.
Both [Quine and Feyerabend] want to revise a version of positivism. Quine started with the Vienna Circle, and Feyerabend with the Copenhagen school of quantum mechanics. Both the Circle and the school have been called children of Ernst Mach; if so, the philosophies of Feyerabend and Quine must be his grandchildren.
Boundary, n. In political geography, an imaginary line between two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the imaginary rights of another.
Brahman is the ultimate reality; it is simultaneously Saguna and Nirguna; divisions are due to ignorance. Mind and intellect can never catch hold of it; they have only one option and that is to merge with it.
Brand is not a product, that's for sure; it's not one item. It's an idea, it's a theory, it's a meaning, it's how you carry yourself. It's aspirational, it's inspirational.
Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility.
Breakdowns can create breakthroughs. Things fall apart so things can fall together.
Breaking the law of gravity isn't painful it's getting caught that hurts.
Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure.
Bring the mind into sharp focus and make it alert so that it can immediately intuit truth, which is everywhere. The mind must be emancipated from old habits, prejudices, restrictive thought processes and even ordinary thought itself.
Buddha can show you the light, but it is up to you to turn it on.
Buffett does enjoy being a billionaire, but in offbeat ways. As he put it, though money cannot change your health or how many people love you, it lets you be in 'more interesting environments.
Build a cottage by the roadside, and you will not get it finished in three years.
Build something 100 people love, not something 1 million people kind of like.
Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.
Business gives you a massive high. Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution... It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.
Business people - Your business - is your greatest prejudice: it ties you to your locality, to the company you keep, to the inclinations you feel. Diligent in business - but indolent in spirit, content with your inadequacy, and with the cloak of duty hung over this contentment: that is how you live, that is how you want your children to live!
But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but i laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
But groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind worth having.
But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge.
But I being fond of true philosophy,
...but if a thing is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.
But I like not these great success of yours; for I know how jealous are the gods.
But I realized something. About art. And psychiatry. They're both self-perpetuating systems. Like religion. All
But is all this true?" said Brutha.
But it so happens that everything on this planet is, ultimately, irrational; there is not, and cannot be, any reason for the causal connexion of things, if only because our use of the word "reason" already implies the idea of causal connexion. But, even if we avoid this fundamental difficulty, Hume said that causal connexion was not merely unprovable, but unthinkable; and, in shallower waters still, one cannot assign a true reason why water should flow down hill, or sugar taste sweet in the mouth. Attempts to explain these simple matters always progress into a learned lucidity, and on further analysis retire to a remote stronghold where every thing is irrational and unthinkable.
But love, like the sun that it is, sets afire and melts everything. what greed and privilege to build up over whole centuries the indignation of a pious spirit, with its natural following of oppressed souls, will cast down with a single shove.
But no: he was empty, he was confronted by a vast anger, a desperate anger, he saw it and could almost have touched it. But it was inert - if it were to live and find expression and suffer, he must lend it his own body. It was other people's anger. "Swine!" He clenched his fists, he strode along, but nothing came, the anger remained external to himself.
But only he who, himself enlightened, is not afraid of shadows.
But some of the greatest achievements in philosophy could only be compared with taking up some books which seemed to belong together, and putting them on different shelves; nothing more being final about their positions than that they no longer lie side by side. The onlooker who doesn't know the difficulty of the task might well think in such a case that nothing at all had been achieved.
But spontaneity is not by any means a blind, disorderly urge, a mere power of caprice. A philosophy restricted to the alternatives of conventional language has no way of conceiving an intelligence which does not work according to plan, according to a one-at-a-time order of thought. Yet the concrete evidence of such an intelligence is right to hand in our own thoughtlessly ordered bodies. For the Tao does not 'know' how it produces the universe just as we do not 'know' how we construct our brains.
Butterflies don't know their wings' Colors, but others see their Splendor.
But the best teams I've encountered have one important thing in common: their team structure and processes cover a full range of distinct competencies necessary for success.
But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.
But the goal of the arts, culinary or otherwise, is not to increase our comfort. That is the goal of an easy chair.
But this wealth of information produced little or no insight.
But time given to wishing for what can't be is not only spent, but wasted, and for all that we waste we shall be accountable.
But understanding will always require some effort. You probably wouldn't admire a friend who was good at everything if it cost her no effort.
But what is it good for?
But where was God now, with heaven full of astronauts, and the Lord overthrown? I miss God. I miss the company of someone utterly loyal. I still don't think of God as my betrayer. The servants of God, yes, but servants by their very nature betray. I miss God who was my friend. I don't even know if God exists, but I do know that if God is your emotional role model, very few human relationships will match up to it. I have an idea that one day it might be possible, I thought once it had become possible, and that glimpse has set me wandering, trying to find the balance between earth and sky. If the servants hadn't rushed in and parted us, I might have been disappointed, might have snatched off the white samite to find a bowl of soup.
By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
By heavens! there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.
By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.
By now you must have guessed: I come from another planet. But I will never say to you, Take me to your leaders. Even I - unused to your ways though I am - would never make that mistake. We ourselves have such beings among us, made of cogs, pieces of paper, small disks of shiny metal, scraps of coloured cloth. I do not need to encounter more of them.
By now, you've probably caught on to something: my mother is always standing by with just the right Scripture or inspirational saying to get me through any tough situation.
By providing clear objectives for your team, and setting guardrails for how they get there, you will set them on the path to success.
By searching out origins, one becomes a crab. The historian looks backward; eventually he also believes backward.
By that which you kill are you bound.
By the time we began to understand enough about what the world to ask the right questions, our visit is over, and someone else is visiting, asking the same questions.
By the way, if you get mad at your Mac laptop and wonder who designed this demonic device, notice the manufacturer's icon on top: an apple with a bite out of it.
By what men think, we create the world around us, daily new.
Calling sex by its name thereafter [the 17th c.] became more difficult and more costly. As if in order to gain mastery of it in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the level of language, control its free circulation in speech, expunge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the words that rendered it too visibly present.
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.
Call it "a wonder" or "a mystery" and you have an excuse to never try understanding it - an excuse to not take responsibility for it. People knew about love no more than they knew about Science, but at least most did not jump into Science headstrong, with the hope that they would figure it out as they went, or that some "mysterious" inborn trait would take care of it.
Call no man happy until he is dead.
Calvin:"It says here that 'religion is the opiate of the masses.'...what do you suppose that means?"
Can all this just be an accident? Or could there be some alien intelligence behind it?
Can an ass be tragic? To perish under a burden one can neither bear nor throw off? The case of the philosopher.
Can a woman not walk with her possessions down the street of a city?
C and Lisp stand at opposite ends of the spectrum; they're each great at what the other one sucks at.
Cannibals? Who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgement, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate de fois gras.
Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?
Care and diligence bring luck.
Caring can be learned by all human beings, can be worked into the design of every life, meeting an individual need as well as a pervasive need in society.
Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys.
Carry not the Olympic torch, but carry the torch of love instead.
Carry on any enterprise as if all future success depended on it.
Cats don't need to be possessed; they're evil on their own.
Caution: do not look into laser with remaining eye.
Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputations can never effect a reform.
Certain things catch your eye, but pursue only those that capture the heart.
Certain things in life are more important than the usual crap that everyone strives for.
Certainty a strange Ferris wheel of a statement!
Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.
Challenge is the pathway to engagement and progress in our lives. But not all challenges are created equal. Some challenges make us feel alive, engaged, connected, and fulfilled. Others simply overwhelm us. Knowing the difference as you set bigger and bolder challenges for yourself is critical to your sanity, success, and satisfaction.
Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new center of gravity. Don't fight them. Just find a new way to stand.
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
Champions extend their limits and make things happen.
Champions keep playing until they get it right.
Chance favors the prepared mind.
Change can either challenge or threaten us. Your beliefs pave your way to success or block you.
Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine.
Change is not always growth, but growth is often rooted in change.
Change is not a threat. Change opens the door of opportunity and makes our lives better.
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
Character is much easier kept than recovered.

Character is your beauty; style is your strength.
Charity activities are the force which gives our life meaning.

Chase a dog down a passage, and he will turn again and bite you.
Cheapen words and they'll cheapen you
Check your ego at the door. The ego can be the great success inhibitor. It can kill opportunities, and it can kill success.
Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul, the blueprints of your ultimate achievements.

Children are apt to live up to what you believe of them.
Children are like sponges; they start to smell after a little while.
Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.
Chiron had said once that nations were the most foolish of mortal inventions. "No man is worth more than another, wherever he is from."
Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.
Choose not to be harmed, and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed, and you haven't been.
Choose something you like to do. I know it's a cliche, and you've heard it over and over. But the reason is, you're going to have to work long and hard to achieve any success. You better like it or life is going to be terrible.
Choose to be happy. It is what we have all done.
Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, certainly, but degenerated to Vice.
Christianity, like genius, is one of the hardest concepts to forgive. We hear what we want to hear and accept what we want to accept, for the most part, simply because there is nothing more offensive than feeling like you have to re-evaluate your own train of thought and purpose in life. You have to die to an extent in your hunger for faith, for wisdom, and quite frankly, most people aren't ready to die.
Christmas is a season of outdoor lights, but it is also the season of enlightening the heart and mind.
Christmas may be just one day of the year, but love is for 365 days of the year.
Christmas means the birth of a new beginning, a new mind, and a new life.
Cinema is the ultimate pervert art. It doesn't give you what you desire - it tells you how to desire.
Cinta memperindah hidup kita sebab pengalaman cinta pada dasarnya indah dan memperindah seluruh semesta. Mencintai seseorang atau sesuatu berarti mengabdikan yang tidak abadi, memuliakan yang tidak bermoral, meninggikan yang rendah, dan memperindah yang buruk rupa. Apapun yang terlihat oleh mata yang menatap penuh cinta selalu kelihatan cantik, selalu indah di mata - Pitirim Sorokin
C++ is history repeated as tragedy. Java is history repeated as farce.
C++ is like teenage sex: Everybody is talking about it all the time, only few are really doing it.
Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.
Civilization is only possible for deeply unpleasant animals. It is only an ape that can be truly civilized.
Clever isn't the same as sensible," said Susan, "and they do say that if you wish to walk the path to wisdom then for your first step you must become as a small child."
Clever men are sometimes the dupes of their own cleverness.
Cleverness is serviceable for everything, sufficient for nothing.
Close your eyes to see the light of your love. It is what is enlightening the whole world. You don't see things with your eyes. You see them through your perceptions, emotions, and imaginations.
Clouds are just wisps of nature.
Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.
Code is poetry.
Color comes to life when you add a little love.
Come back later, I am sleeping.
Comedy aims at representing men as worse, Tragedy as better than in actual life.
Come let's defy.
Comfort is the enemy of achievement.
Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.
Coming to Nashville has been so motivating and inspirational. Just watching people live and breathe their music and create something that they can feel from start to finish.
Commerce and justice are not divorceable notions.
Commercialization comes at a price.
Commercial success still hasn't come to an artist that isn't signed to a record label. There are very few artists that can succeed without the help of a record label. The role of the record label is still required, it's still necessary.
Commitment, belief and positive attitude are all important if you're going to be a success, whether you're in sports, in business or, as in my case, anthropology.
Commitment in the face of conflict produces character.
Common-Law judges sometimes talk about the law, and schoolmasters talk about the latin tongue, in a way to make their hearers think they mean entities pre-existent to the decisions or the words and syntax, determining them unequivocally and requiring them to obey. But the slightest exercise of reflection makes us see that, instead of being principles of this kind, both law and latin are results. [...] Truth grafts itself on previous truth, modifying it in the process, just as idiom grafts itself on previous idiom, and law on previous law.
Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.
Communism is the final logic of the dehumanization of man.
Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the SECONDARY role.
Compassion is the basis of all morality
Compassion is the desire that moves the individual self to widen the scope of its self-concern to embrace the whole of the universal self.
Compassion will cure more sins than condemnation.
Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.
Composing music is hard work.
Comprehending and knowing better and deeper are the best guarantees we can have to attain ideas and criteria of our own; i.e. to stop depending on what other people say. In summary, to be freer to choose our own path in life.
Compromise brings harmony to both, happiness to none.
Compromise in a dispute between friends is rarely regretted.
Compromise is the art of dividing a cake so everyone believes he got the biggest piece.
Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are.
Computers are useless. They can only give answers.
Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.
Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.
Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes.
Concerning Concealment as a symptom of love for Krsna:
Conditions are never perfect. 'Someday' is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.... If it's important to you and you want to do it 'eventually,' just do it and correct course along the way.
Confidence is preparation. Everything else is beyond your control.
Confidence, like art, never comes from having all the answers; it comes from being open to all the questions.
Confidence...thrives on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection and on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.
Conformity to the present is invisibility to the future.
Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of production and trade...
Consciousness: that annoying time between naps.
Conservatism is the antidote to tyranny. It's the only one. It's based on thousands of years of human experience. There is nothing narrow about the conservative philosophy. It's a liberating philosophy. It is a magnificent philosophy. It is a philosophy for the ages, for all times.
Consider a fruitful career as a witch.
Considering he was neither priest nor scholar, the young man gave sensible, thoughtful replies -- the more so, perhaps, for being untrained, for he had not learned what he should believe or should not believe. Present a statement to him in flagrant contradiction to all Christian doctrine and he could be persuaded to agree on its good sense, unless he remembered it was the sort of thing of which pyres are made for the incautious.
Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline.
Consider purchasing a kazoo.
Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by. They do not know what is meant by yesterday or today, they leap about, eat, rest, digest, leap about again, and so from morn till night and from day to day, fettered to the moment and its pleasure or displeasure, and thus neither melancholy nor bored. [...] A human being may well ask an animal: 'Why do you not speak to me of your happiness but only stand and gaze at me?' The animal would like to answer, and say, 'The reason is I always forget what I was going to say' - but then he forgot this answer too, and stayed silent.
Consider the postage stamp: its usefulness consists in the ability to stick to one thing till it gets there.
Consider the whole world reconnoitre individuals j who is there whose life is not taken up with providing for to morrow Do you ask what harm there is in this An infinite deal for such men do not live but are about to live they defer every thing from day to day however circumspect we are life will still outrun us.
Constant dripping hollows out a stone.
Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.
Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty.
Contentment protects even against colds. Has a woman who knew herself to be well dressed ever caught cold? I am assuming that she was barely dressed.
Contrary to the ecologists, nature does not stand still and does not maintain the kind of equilibrium that guarantees the survival of any particular species - least of all the survival of her greatest and most fragile product: man.
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
...convinced that in trying to please all, he had pleased none, and had lost his ass into the bargain.
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there.
Could two live that way? Could two live under the wild rose, and explore by the pond, so that the smooth mind of each is as everywhere present to the other, and as received and as unchallenged, as falling snow?
Countless as the sands of the sea are human passions.
Courage is about doing what you're afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you're scared.
Courage is almost a contradiction in terms: it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.
Courage is a special kind of knowledge: the knowledge of how to fear what ought to be feared and how not to fear what ought not to be feared.
Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are stiffened.
Courage is grace under pressure.
Courage is knowing what not to fear.
Courage is like love; it must have hope for nourishment.
Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.
Courage is only the accumulation of small steps.
Courage is resistance to fear, master of fear, not absence of fear.
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear.
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absense of fear.
Courage is the art of being the only one that knows you're scared to death.
Courage is the ladder on which all the other virtues mount.
Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace. The soul that knows it not, knows no release from little things; knows not the livid loneliness of fear.
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
Courage, my friends; 'tis not too late to build a better world.
Cram them full of non-combustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.
Crave for a thing, you will get it. Renounce the craving, the object will follow you by itself.
Crazy Horse dreamed and went into the world where there is nothing but the spirits of all things. That is the real world that is behind this one, and everything we see here is something like a shadow from that one.
Create each day anew.
Create. Not for the money. Not for the fame. Not for the recognition. But for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it.
Creation and destruction are the two ends of the same moment. And everything between the creation and the next destruction is the journey of life.
Creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity.
Creativity doesn't wait for that perfect moment. It fashions its own perfect moments out of ordinary ones.
Creativity is a natural extension of our enthusiasm.
Creativity Is Intelligence Having Fun.
Creativity is intelligence having fun.
Creativity is the key to success in the future, and primary education is where teachers can bring creativity in children at that level.
Creativity sparks originality which then manifests itself into what we call evolution. To depreciate imagination is to depreciate life.
Creativity takes courage.
Criticism of others is thus an oblique form of self-commendation. We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked.
Crowded classrooms and half-day sessions are a tragic waste of our greatest national resource - the minds of our children.
C's great for what it's great for.
Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.
Culture had worked in her own case, but during the last few weeks she had doubted whether it humanized the majority, so wide and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man, so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it.
Currently, only 70 percent of our high school students earn diplomas with their peers, and less than one-third of our high school students graduate prepared for success in a four-year college.
Curse of God, Guru can remove.
Dad was a philosopher and had what he called his Theory of Purpose, which held that everything in life had a purpose, and unless it achieved that purpose, it was just taking up space on the planet and wasting everybody's time.
Daily dance uplift the soul to spiritual realms.
Dance like it hurts. Love like you need money. Work when people are watching. -- Dogbert's Motto
Dance on a white page to reveal your passionate perception of inner madness.
Dare to be true: nothing can need a lie: A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby.
Dare to dream big. Dream while you are awake, and let those dreams take your sleep away.
Dare to reach out your hand into the darkness, to pull another hand into the light.
Deacon Jones has been the most inspirational person in my football career.
Dead men walk where the flames are hottest.
Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve. Success is also easy to handle: You've solved the wrong problem. Work hard to improve.
Death is coming.
Death is never an excuse to stop living.
Death isn't the end, it's the beginning.
Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity.
Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent; it clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Death offers us the chance of a new beginning and a chance to help others instead of helping ourselves.
Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.
Death twitches my ear;
Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it.
Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.
Dedicate some of your life to others. Your dedication will not be a sacrifice. It will be an exhilarating experience because it is an intense effort applied toward a meaningful end.
Deep connection is the antidote to madness.
Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true failure.
Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.
Definitions are the guardians of rationality, the first line of defense against the chaos of mental disintegration.
De jure objections are arguments of claims to the effect that Christian belief, whether or not true, is at any rate unjustifiable, or rationally unjustified, or irrational, or not intellectually respectable, or contrary to sound morality, or without sufficient evidence, or in some other way rationally unacceptable, not up to snuff from an intellectual point of view.
Deliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.
Democracy is four wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.
Democracy is the worst possible form of government, except for all the others.
Democracy should always be viewed with a philosophical perspective rather than a political one, because after all democracy was born to a philosopher and murdered by a politician.
Depart not from the path which fate has you assigned.
Deserve your dream.
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
Desire is the key to motivation, but it's determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek.
Desire is the key to motivation, but it's the determination and commitment to unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek.
Desire is the most important factor in the success of any athlete.
Despair and disappointment are the parent of countless inspired, inspiring, triumphant creations.
Despair is the clothing of the hopeless don't wear them
Despair is the price one pays for setting oneself an impossible aim. It is, one is told, the unforgivable sin, but it is a sin the corrupt or evil man never practices. He always has hope. He never reaches the freezing-point of knowing absolute failure. Only the man of goodwill carries always in his heart this capacity for damnation.
Despair is typical of those who do not understand the causes of evil, see no way out, and are incapable of struggle.
Despair shows us the limit of our imagination. Imaginations shared create collaboration, and collaboration creates community, and community inspires social change.
Despite its successes, in the end, philosophical thinking always falls short of its real goal. It involves both the wonder of aspiring toward the Truth and the distress of falling short of that Truth. In this way, philosophy can be characterized as wondrous distress.
Despite the heart numbing frost, my soul is blooming like spring.
Despite the success cult, men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of the effort involved in getting there - or failing to get there.
Dessert can make you happy.
Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice.
Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.
Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.
Devotion to the truth is the hallmark of morality; there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.
Did you have a rough month? I did :( but, you know what? There's no time to dwell on a missed opportunity or worry about what I should've done or said, beating myself up
Did you know that a community of holes is called a pit?
Did you know the word gullible is not in the dictionary?
Different languages, the same thoughts; servant to thoughts and their masters.
Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
Digression is the soul of wit. Take the philosophic asides away from Dante, Milton or Hamlet's father's ghost and what stays is dry bones.
Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to bubble up, if you just dig.
Diligence is the mother of good fortune.
Diligence is the mother of good luck.
Diplomacy is the art of saying 'good doggie' while looking for a bigger stick.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all.
Discourse on virtue and they pass by in droves. Whistle and dance and shimmy, and you've got an audience!
Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or stupid enough? Or--or---"
Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty.
Distraction serves evil more than any other mental state.
Diversity is the one true thing we all have in common. Celebrate it every day.
Division isn't just a math's problem.
Divorce is never a pleasant experience. You look upon it as a failure. But I learned to be a different person once we broke up. Sometimes you learn more from failure than you do from success.
Does it just look nice or is it correct?
Dogs and philosophers do the greatest good and get the fewest rewards.
Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.
Doing your best means never stop trying.
Do it now.Sometimes 'later' becomes 'never'.
Do it or don't do it -- you will regret both.
Do more of what makes you happy.
Do more than belong: participate. Do more than care: help. Do more than believe: practice. Do more than be fair: be kind. Do more than forgive: forget. Do more than dream: work.
Do not accept anything because it comes from the mouth of a respected person.
Do not bring people in your life who weigh you down. And trust your instincts ... good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don't hurt. They're not painful. That's not just with somebody you want to marry, but it's with the friends that you choose. It's with the people you surround yourselves with.
Do not count the days; make the days count.
Do not fear mistakes - there are none.
Do not fear mistakes. You will know failure. Continue to reach out.
Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.
Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
Do not let your ethics suffer from your extraordinary success.
Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men.
Do not ruin today with mourning tomorrow.
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for.
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.
Do not trouble about those who practice philosophy, whether they are good or bad; but examine the thing itself well and carefully. And if philosophy appears a bad thing to you, turn every man from it, not only your sons; but if it appears to you such as I think it to be, take courage, pursue it, and practice it, as the saying is, 'both you and your house.
Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.
Do not watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going.
Do not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand.
Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.
Don't allow your wounds to turn you into a person you are not.
Don't appreciate me, I'm not up to it. Don't criticize me, I don't deserve it. Just be my friend and forgive me, because I am craving for it.
Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.
Don't be afraid of failure; be afraid of petty success.
Don't be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the beginning.
Don't be afraid to be amazing.
Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.

Don't be distracted by criticism. Remember--the only taste of success some people get is to take a bite out of you.
Don't be pushed by your problems; be led by your dreams.
Don't blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for "the average programmer" — you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.
Don't blame the boss. He has enough problems.
Don't compete with me: firstly, I have more experience, and secondly, I have chosen the weapons.
Don't complain about what you don't have. Use what you've got. To be less than your best is a sin.
Don't confuse fame with success. Madonna is one; Helen Keller is the other.
Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it.
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have, and should have.
Don't fear the gods,
Don't fight the problem, decide it.
Don't give up. Don't lose hope. Don't sell out.
Don't give up just because things get hard. Give up if you feel in your gut that moving on is the right choice for you.
Don't give up, Today is hard. Tomorrow will be worse. Day after tomorrow will be sunshine.
Don't give up your greatness because of someone's cynicism or narrowness of mind.
Dont give users the opportunity to lock themselves.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.

Don't hate the media; become the media.
Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents." Translation by Sharon Lebell
Don't let nobody tell you that you can't do it. Love what you do until you don't love it anymore. Nothing's impossible.

Don't look for a way out, look for a challenge to engage in.
Don't lose a woman that has seen your flaws and still loves you.

Don't only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and knowledge can raise men to the divine.

Don't play the game in a half-baked way. Either get all the way in or all the way out.
Don't raise your voice, improve your argument.
Don't reject something just because it seems strange. It's comfort that will kill you in the end.

Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed.
Don't talk about yourself so much... we'll do that when you leave.
Don't tell people how to do things; tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.
Don't think about making art, just get it done.  Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it.  While they are deciding, make even more art.
Don't think, but look! (PI 66)
Don't think, just do.
Don't think you're on the right road just because it's a well-beaten path.
Don't use a big word where a diminutive one will suffice.
Don't use a lot where a little will do.
Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them.
Don't wait for people to be friendly. Show them how.
Don't wait for the bus when you should be the bus driver.
Don't wait for your feelings to change to take the action. Take the action and your feelings will change.

Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Don't worry.
Don't worry about avoiding temptation - as you grow older, it starts avoiding you.
Don't worry about failure; you only have to be right once.
Don't worry about temptation--as you grow older, it starts avoiding you.
Don't worry about the world ending today, it's already tomorrow in Australia
Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Don't worry if people don't like you. Most people are struggling to like themselves.
Don't worry so much about your self- esteem. Worry more about your character. Integrity is its own reward.
Don't write to sell, write to tell.
Don't you just long to be someone else?
Don't you think most of those kids think too much about who got an A or a B when they were in law school and what that means to an inflated G.P.A. and not enough about the world?" asked Connor irrelevantly.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
Do only what only you can do.
Do something wonderful, people may imitate it.
Do something you really like, and hopefully it pays the rent. As far as I'm concerned, that's success.
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.
Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest.
Do the scary thing first, and get scared later.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
Do whatever you do intensely.
Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.
Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
Do What You Can With All You Have, Wherever You Are.
Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you'll be criticized anyway.
'Do What You Gotta Do' is a positive, inspirational song that says no matter what it is; whether you're up against challenges or trying to get your dreams and aspirations met, you should do what whatever you have to do shy of killing yourself or someone else.
down with hell and heaven and all the religious fuss
Do you believe in God, doctor?"
Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon itself? And it is of course overestimated, for it is of necessity prejudiced in its own favour. Take that man I had aloft. He held on as if he were a precious thing, a treasure beyond diamonds of rubies. To you? No. To me? Not at all. To himself? Yes. But I do not accept his estimate. He sadly overrates himself. There is plenty more life demanding to be born. Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck like honey from the comb, there would have been no loss to the world. The supply is too large.
Do you know what I think about crying? I think some people have to learn to do it. But once you learn, once you know how to really cry, there's nothing quite like it. I feel sorry for those who don't know the trick. It's like whistling or singing.
Do you know what punishments I've endured for my crimes, my sins? None. I am proof of the absurdity of men's most treasured abstractions. A just universe wouldn't tolerate my existence.
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
Do you not think that God will protect us?"
Do your best for your parents. If you don't, one day you will regret it.
Do you remember any instance where tyranny was destroyed and freedom established on its ruins, among a people possessing so small a share of virtue and public spirit? I recollect none, and this more than the British arms makes me fearful of final success, without a reform.
Do your little bit of good where you are; it's those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world.
Do your own thing on your own terms and get what you came here for.
Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - there's so little competition.
Do you see the slightest evidence anywhere in the universe that creation came to an end with the birth of man? Do you see the slightest evidence anywhere out there that man was the climax toward which creation had been straining from the beginning? ...Very far from it. The universe went on as before, the planet went on as before. Man's appearance caused no more stir than the appearance of jellyfish.
Do you shovel to survive, or survive to shovel?
Do you think you wear a mask?'
Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Do you want to achieve something or do you just want to make money?" asked a nearby man in a white shirt to another man in a striped shirt. I waited for the answer as I slowly walked past them.
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.
Do you want to sell sugared water all your life or do you want to change the world?
Do you want to walk along? Or walk ahead? Or walk by yourself? One must know what one wants and that one wants. Fourth question of conscience.
Do you wish to rise? Begin by descending. You plan a tower that will pierce the clouds? Lay first the foundation of humility.
Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing.
Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them is not something dreadful also.
Dream big and dare to fail.
Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.
Dreams come in a size too big so that we may grow into them.
Dreams have only one owner at a time. That's why dreamers are lonely.
Dreams. They start in your beautiful mind. Think of beautiful things and it will manifest into actions because your body will listen to you. Like it always does.
Dream your dream. Follow your heart. Imagine. Listen to the wind. Drink sunsets. Be free. Let the wonder never cease. Believe. Wish on EVERY star. Create adventure. Be Kind.
Dress to express not to impress.
Dress yourself in such a way that it shows that you love yourself.
Dress yourself to define yourself.

Dullness in matters of government is a good sign, and not a bad one - in particular, dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence, an indication of its success.
Duty measures the distance between animal and the divine.
Each child is an adventure into a better life - an opportunity to change the old pattern and make it new.
Each contact with a human being is so rare, so precious, one should preserve it.
Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.
Each day offers us the gift of being a special occasion if we can simply learn that as well as giving, it is blessed to receive with grace and a grateful heart.
Each day provides its own gifts.
Each day when I awake I know I have one more day to make a difference in someone's life.
Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.
Each religion makes scores of purportedly factual assertions about everything from the creation of the universe to the afterlife. But on what grounds can believers presume to know that these assertions are true? The reasons they give are various, but the ultimate justification for most religious people's beliefs is a simple one: we believe what we believe because our holy scriptures say so. But how, then, do we know that our holy scriptures are factually accurate? Because the scriptures themselves say so. Theologians specialize in weaving elaborate webs of verbiage to avoid saying anything quite so bluntly, but this gem of circular reasoning really is the epistemological bottom line on which all 'faith' is grounded. In the words of Pope John Paul II: 'By the authority of his absolute transcendence, God who makes himself known is also the source of the credibility of what he reveals.' It goes without saying that this begs the question of whether the texts at issue really were authored or inspired by God, and on what grounds one knows this. 'Faith' is not in fact a rejection of reason, but simply a lazy acceptance of bad reasons. 'Faith' is the pseudo-justification that some people trot out when they want to make claims without the necessary evidence.
Each star is a mirror reflecting the truth inside you.
Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem.
Each sunrise brings a new day filled with new hopes for a new beginning.
Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage, and confidence in the doing.
Each voice carries a portion of value, no matter how unpalatable or distasteful that voice may be: no one person, government, ideology, transnational, or religious institution can own and dominate the whole.

Earn your success based on service to others, not at the expense of others.
Easter spells out beauty, the rare beauty of new life.
Eccentricity is not, as some would believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd.
Economic power is exercised by means of a positive, by offering men a reward, an incentive, a payment, a value; political power is exercised by means of a negative, by the threat of punishment, injury, imprisonment, destruction. The businessman's tool is values; the bureaucrat's tool is fear.
Education, actual learning--it is hard work. It's very personal. Your parents don't teach you anything. Your teachers don't teach you anything. The government doesn't teach you anything. You read it. You don't understand it; you read it again. You break a pencil and read it again.
Education costs money.  But then so does ignorance.
Education is meaningless without manners
Education is the best provision for old age.
Education is the key to success in life, and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students.
Effort is only effort when it begins to hurt.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
Einstein argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature, because God is not capricious or arbitrary.

Embrace what you don't know, especially in the beginning, because what you don't know can become your greatest asset. It ensures that you will absolutely be doing things different from everybody else.
Empiricism teaches that there is a real world of fixed things on the outside and that ideas of these outside things are stamped on the mind which is at the beginning of life a blank.
Empty is the argument of the philosopher which does not relieve any human suffering.
Empty pockets never held anyone back. Only empty heads and empty hearts can do that.
Encouragement is the oxygen of the soul.
Encouragement of higher education for our youth is critical to the success of our collective future.
Energy and persistence conquer all things.
Enjoy failure and learn from it. You can never learn from success.
Enjoying success requires the ability to adapt. Only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent.
Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.
Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must.
Enjoy your sweat because hard work doesn't guarantee success, but without it you don't have a chance.
Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred tutelage. Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another. Self-incurred is this tutelage when its cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of resolution and courage to use it without direction from another. Sapere aude! 'Have courage to use your own reason!'- that is the motto of enlightenment.
Entertainment is just talking louder than the audience.
Entertainment is temporary happiness, but the real happiness is permanent entertainment.
Enthusiasm is the greatest asset in the world. It beats money, power, and influence.
Enthusiasm is the mother of effort, and without it nothing great was ever achieved.
Enthusiasm moves the world.
Entrepreneurs can't forecast accurately, because they are trying something fundamentally new. So they will often be laughably behind plan - and on the brink of success.
Entrepreneurship is like a computer game in which you have to master every level before achieving success. Startups repeatedly stumble and have to go back to the drawing board. The best way to skip some levels and to increase the odds of survival is to learn from others who have already played the game.
Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice.
Ethics are not always ethical just as morals are not always moral.

Even a soul submerged in sleep
Even concubinage has been corrupted--by marriage.
Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.
Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Even if you are alone you wage war with yourself.
Even if you fall on your face you're still moving forward.
Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward.
Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.
Even if you win the rat race, you're still a rat.
...even nursery tales only echo an almost pre-natal leap of interest and amazement. These tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they were green. They make rivers run with wine only to make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water.
Even successful musicians have had periods where people say they suck and no one likes them, even after they've had periods of great success. So I think it's like you just gotta do you and try to stay motivated. Until, you know, you decide to stay home and make spaghetti all day.
Even the finest sword plunged into salt water will eventually rust.
Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage for that which he really knows.
Even though people about us choose the path of hate and violence and warfare and greed and prejudice, we who are Christ's body must throw off these poisons and let love permeate and cleanse every tissue and cell. Nor are we to allow ourselves to become easily discouraged when love is not always obviously successful or pleasant. Love never quits, even when an enemy has hit you on the right cheek and you have turned the other, and he's also hit that.
Eventually soul mates meet, for they have the same hiding place.
Even when disco went out, I could still make hits. Once I had so much success, every idea became concentrated. I had so much confidence. I knew how the bass should sound, what rhythms would work. The tempos I knew: 110 to 120 BPM. I knew they would dance in the clubs in New York or anywhere.
Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
Every artist was first an amateur.
Every being, created by God and unspoiled by man, is perfect, strictly defined and autonomous, entirely complete and at the same time with a built-in ability to grow and develop. This is the essence of its dignity and holiness. It is not an embodiment of God's immense Personality, but only one of the realisations of His perfection.
Everybody has a great idea for a startup, and so do their relatives, and they tell me, 'You gotta build it.' I say, 'I have to believe in it.'
Everybody knows that Aristotelian two-value logic is fucked.
Everybody lies, but it doesn't matter since nobody listens.
Everybody makes their own fun. If you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun -- it's entertainment.
Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it'll pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off.
Every calling is great when greatly pursued.

Everyday may not be good but there is something good in everyday.
Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day.
Every day of my life I walk with the idea that I am black, no matter how successful I am. And our success is tempered by that; you're successful in this way given the fact you are black, and most blacks don't get to that point.
Every day we should hear at least one little song, read one good poem, see one exquisite picture, and, if possible, speak a few sensible words.
Every day you have the opportunity to learn and experience some-thing and some-one new. Seize the opportunity. Learn and experience everything you can, and use it to change the world.
Every excess becomes a vice.
Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.
Every exit is an entry somewhere else.
Every form of happiness if one, every desire is driven by the same motor--by our love for a single value, for the highest potentiality of our own existence--and every achievement is an expression of it.
Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
Every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse behind it in the world, and bettered the tradition of mankind.

Every life has a destiny... the trick is to discover it before then end of your life. Otherwise, you will have too many regrets.
Every life is different because you passed this way and touched history.
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.

Every man's life is a fairy tale written by God's fingers.

Every moment and every event of every man's life on earth plants something in his soul.
... every moment of our life has a purpose, that every action of ours, no matter how dull or routine or trivial it may seem in itself, has a dignity and a worth beyond human understanding... For it means that no moment can be wasted, no opportunity missed, since each has a purpose in man's life, each has a purpose in God's plan. Think of your day, today or yesterday. Think of the work you did, the people you met, moment by moment. What did it mean to you- and might it have meant for God? Is the question too simple to answer, or are we just afraid to ask it for fear of the answer we must give?
Every new day is an opportunity to grow your love.
Everyone has a photographic memory, some just don't have film.
Everyone has a plan 'til they get punched in the mouth.
Everyone has a story, make your own worth telling.

Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.
Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.
Everyone who achieves success in a great venture, solves each problem as they came to it. They helped themselves. And they were helped through powers known and unknown to them at the time they set out on their voyage. They keep going regardless of the obstacles they met.
Everyone who has ever built anywhere a "new heaven" first found the power thereto in his own hell.
Every passion borders on the chaotic, but the collector's passion borders on the chaos of memories.
Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat. Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win - essential to success.
Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement.
Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art: It arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethics or political philosophy). It is the front trench in the siege of truth. Science is the captured territory, and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and marvelous world. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed, but only because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passes on, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and unexplored.
Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the usual sense of this opposition), as a small or large unity, can be cited, put between quotation marks; thereby it can break with every given context, and engender infinitely new contexts in an absolutely nonsaturable fashion. This does not suppose that the mark is valid outside its context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center of absolute anchoring. This citationality, duplication, or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is not an accident or anomaly, but is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could no longer even have a so-called "normal" functioning. What would a mark be that one could not cite? And whose origin could not be lost on the way?
Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.
Every soldier must know, before he goes into battle, how the little battle he is to fight fits into the larger picture, and how the success of his fighting will influence the battle as a whole.
Every song you're trying to find something that going to connect in different ways but for me the songs that I'm really drawn to are inspirational, songs that lift you and that everybody can relate to no matter where you're from.
Every story I create, creates me. I write to create myself.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
Every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists, and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order.
Every success story has a parent who says, 'over my dead body.' Every success story has an old person who walks up to you and says, when you're acting the fool, 'you know I worry about you sometimes.'
Everything about us, everything around us, everything we know and can know of is composed ultimately of patterns of nothing; that's the bottom line, the final truth. So where we find we have any control over those patterns, why not make the most elegant ones, the most enjoyable and good ones, in our own terms? Yes, we're hedonists, Mr. Bora Horza Gobuchul. We seek pleasure and have fashioned ourselves so that we can take more of it; admitted. We are what we are. But what about you? What does that make you?
Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity.

Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.
Everything we know is only some kind of approximation.
Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see, but it is impossible. Humans hide their secrets too well....
Everything you do leaves behind a fingerprint of your personality.
Everything you know is past. And with that disgusting arrogance of knowing the past, one cannot know something novel.
Everything you need for better future and success has already been written. And guess what? All you have to do is go to the library.
Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
Everything you want is out there waiting for you to ask. Everything you want also wants you. But you have to take action to get it.

Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.
Every time I close the door on reality it comes in through the windows.
Every truth passes through three stages before it is recognized. In the first, it is ridiculed. In the second, it is opposed. In the third, it is regarded as self-evident.
Every video I've made has an inspirational message behind it. Since day one, I thought, 'Okay, I want my audience to be, like, Disney members.' So if that's the case, I have to keep everything rated G.
Every war, when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defence against a homicidal maniac.
"Evil men have no songs." How is it, then, that the Russians have songs?
Evolution acts slowly. Our psychological characteristics today are those that promoted reproductive success in the ancestral environment.
Excellence can be obtained if you care more than others think is wise, risk more than others think is safe, dream more than others think is practical, expect more than others think is possible.
Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way.
Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.
Excess of strength alone is proof of strength
Existence is beyond the power of words
Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens.
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
Experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger, portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.
Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.
Experience is something you get just after you need it.
Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.
Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.
Expressing doubt is how we begin a journey to discover essential truths.
Failing to prepare is like preparing to fail.
Failure is a bruise, not a tattoo.
Failure is an opportunity to begin again more intelligently.
Failure is a part of success.
Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.
Failure is not our only punishment for laziness; there is also the success of others.

Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
Failure is the key to success; each mistake teaches us something.
Failure is when you stop trying to do something.
Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward toward success.

Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
Fair speech may hide a foul heart.
Faith as an imperative is a veto against science -- in praxi, it means lies at any price.
Faith in faith' he answered himself. 'It isn't necessary to have something to believe in. It's only necessary to believe that somewhere there's something worthy of belief.
Faith in Qur'anic revelation unveils all the possibilities that lie before the human intellect.
Faith in the possibilities of continued and rigorous inquiry does not limit access to truth to any channel or scheme of things. It does not first say that truth is universal and then add there is but one road to it.
Faith is love taking the form of aspiration.
Faith is not belief in spite of evidence but a life in scorn of the consequences.
Faith is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods.
Faith moves mountains, but you have to keep pushing while you're praying.
Fake is the new real,You gotta keep a lot a shit to yourself.
Fall seven times and stand up eight.
False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.
Fame or perceived success - it all comes from groupthink.
Fame, riches and romance are yours for the asking.
Family comes in many forms.
Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of liberty, then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!
Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.
Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.
Far from rejecting outright any hierarchy of success or failure, philosophy instead reconfigures the judging process, lending legitimacy to theidea that themainstream value system may unfairly consign some people to disgrace and others to respectability.
Fas est ab hoste doceri.
Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.
Fault always lies in the same place: with him weak enough to lay blame.
FEAR!
Fear comes in two packages fear of failure, and sometimes, fear of success.
Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth.
Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.
Fear is only as deep as the mind allows.
Fear is the polio of the soul which prevents our walking by faith.
Fearlessness is like a muscle. I know from my own life that the more I exercise it, the more natural it becomes to not let my fears run me.
FEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
Fear makes strangers of those who would be friends.
Fear no more," said Clarissa. Fear no more the heat o' the sun; for the shock of Lady Bruton asking Richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver, as a plant on the river-bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers: so she rocked: so she shivered.
Fear of failure, it's the greatest motivational tool. It drives me and drives me and drives me.
Fear stops people from accomplishing their goals.
Feathers filled the small room. Our laughter kept the feathers in the air. I thought about birds. Could they fly if there wasn't someone, somewhere, laughing?
Feeling anxious or depressed sometimes is part of what it means to be a person, and it might even be essential to success.
Feeling is the consciousness of the resulting conditions - of success, failure, equilibrium, compromise or balance, in this continuous rivalry of ideas.
Feminism is about women having choices and living the life they choose, not about hating men. Many feminists, like me, love and marry men because we choose to embrace being a woman completely and whole-heartedly. - STRONG: Powerful Philosophy for Timeless Thoughts by Kailin Gow.
Festivals and fasts are unhinged, traveling backward at a rate of ten days per year, attached to no season. Even Laylat ul Qadr, the holiest night in Ramadan, drifts--its precise date is unknown. The iconclasm laid down by Muhammed was absolute: you must resist attachment not only to painted images, but to natural ones. Ramadan, Muharram, the Eids; you associate no religious event with the tang of snow in the air, or spring thaw, or the advent of summer. God permeates these things--as the saying goes, Allah is beautiful, and He loves beauty--but they are transient. Forced to concentrate on the eternal, you begin to see, or think you see, the bones and sinews of the world beneath its seasonal flesh. The sun and moon become formidable clockwork. They are transient also, but hint at the dark planes that stretch beyond the earth in every direction, full of stars and dust, toward a retreating, incomprehensible edge
Few among men are they who cross to the further shore. The others merely run up and down the bank on this side.
Few if any seemed to have grasped the Principle of Reality; new knowledge leads always to yet more awesome mysteries. Greater physiological knowledge of the brain makes the existence of the soul less possible yet more probable by the nature of the search.
Few things are more deceptive than memories.
Few things are more important to each individual's future success or to our nation's prosperity than education.
Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him, and to let him know that you trust him.

First, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end.
First impressions are rarely worth preserving. Men typically fall short of our expectations.

Focus on being balanced - success is balance.
Following is one of the most underrated aspects of leadership.... I have seen many a good [organization] underachieve, because someone...thought the commander was incompetent, and quietly worked to undermine his authority.
Follow the advice of your heart.
Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls.
Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Follow your heart, but be quiet for a while first. Ask questions, then feel the answer. Learn to trust your heart.
Follow your inner moonlight; don't hide the madness.
Fools! Don't they know that tears are a woman's most effective weapon?
Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable -- what then?

For a long time now a hint of aversion had lain on everything he did and experienced, a shadow of impotence and loneliness, an all-encompassing distaste for which he could not find the complementary inclination. He felt at times as though he had been born with a talent for which there was at present no objective.
For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of a Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a MaCaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros.
For an act to be evil, you must first perceive it, process and then conceive it as such. Then these acts are effects. They're not causes. And by this I mean that these acts are not of Stream. Now we ask the other question again. What does it take for something, here specifically Stream, to be good or evil?
For an author to write as he speaks is just as reprehensible as the opposite fault, to speak as he writes; for this gives a pedantic effect to what he says, and at the same time makes him hardly intelligible
For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in the programs they produce. More recently I discovered why the use of the go to statement has such disastrous effects, and I became convinced that the go to statement should be abolished from all "higher level" programming languages.
For any given problem, if there's a simple solution it will already have been applied. So, perhaps, the solution isn't as simple as you think.
For axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses.
Forbearance in the face of fate, beauty constant under torture, are not merely passive. They are a positive achievement, an explicit triumph.

For Christians . . . an unreflective faith is not possible if we take seriously the injunction to love God with the mind as well as the heart and soul.
For complex systems, the compiler and development environment need to be in the same language that its supporting. It's the only way to grow code.
Foreknowledge cannot be gotten from ghosts and spirits, cannot be had by analogy, cannot be found out by calculation. It must be obtained from people, people who know the conditions of the enemy.
For every expert there is an equal and opposite expert.
For everyone now strives most of all to seperate his person, wishing to experience the fullness of life within himself, and yet what comes of all his efforts is not the fullness of life, but full suicide, for instead of the fullness of self-definition, they fall into complete isolation.
For every problem there is a solution which is simple, neat and wrong.
For every two minutes of glamour, there are eight hours of hard work.

Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future.
Forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser; of the wrongdoer. It is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of conscience-corrupting abuse.
Forgiveness is the best strategy to find peace. Peace is the best policy to live by.
For happiness is anyone and anything at all that's loved by you.

Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.
For marriage to be a success, every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom. The end.
Formation may be the best name for what happens in a circle of trust, because the word refers, historically, to soul work done in community. But a quick disclaimer is in order, since formation sometimes means a process quite contrary to the one described in this book----a process in which the pressure of orthodox doctrine, sacred text, and institutional authority is applied to the misshapen soul in order to conform it to the shape dictated by some theology. This approach is rooted in the idea that we are born with souls deformed by sin, and our situation is hopeless until the authorities "form" us properly. But all of that is turned upside down by the principles of a circle of trust: I applaud the theologian who said that "the idea of humans being born alienated from the Creator would seem an abominable concept." Here formation flows from the belief that we are born with souls in perfect form. As time goes on, we subject to powers of deformation, from within as well as without, that twist us into shapes alien to the shape of the soul. But the soul never loses its original form and never stops calling us back to our birhtright integrity.
For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.
For me, success is a state of mind. I feel like success isn't about conquering something; it's being happy with who you are.
For me, the first challenge for computing science is to discover how to maintain order in a finite, but very large, discrete universe that is intricately intertwined. And a second, but not less important challenge is how to mould what you have achieved in solving the first problem, into a teachable discipline: it does not suffice to hone your own intellect (that will join you in your grave), you must teach others how to hone theirs. The more you concentrate on these two challenges, the clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin: teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable.
For me, the most fun is change or growth. There are definitely elements of both that I like. Launching a business is kind of like a motorboat: You can go very quickly and turn fast.
For me, writing is immortality. It is wisdom. It is never-ending.

For the former, activity, any kind of activity, was an end in itself; for the latter, activity was but a progress toward the true end, which was rest, and peace of mind. Action was to be undertaken only when equilibrium was disturbed.
For the same reason there is nowhere to begin to trace the sheaf or the graphics of differance. For what is put into question is precisely the quest for a rightful beginning, an absolute point of departure, a principal responsibility. The problematic of writing is opened by putting into question the value of the arkhe. What I will propose here will not be elaborated simply as a philosophical discourse, operating according to principles, postulates, axioms, or definitions, and proceeding along the discursive lines of a linear order of reasons. In the delineation of differance everything is strategic and adventurous. Strategic because no transcendent truth present outside the field of writing can govern theologically the totality of the field. Adventurous because this strategy is a not simple strategy in the sense that strategy orients tactics according to a final goal, a telos or theme of domination, a mastery and ultimate reappropriation of the development of the field. Finally, a strategy without finality, what might be called blind tactics, or empirical wandering if the value of empiricism did not itself acquire its entire meaning in opposition to philosophical responsibility. If there is a certain wandering in the tracing of differance, it no more follows the lines of philosophical-logical discourse than that of its symmetrical and integral inverse, empirical-logical discourse. The concept of play keeps itself beyond this opposition, announcing, on the eve of philosophy and beyond it, the unity of chance and necessity in calculations without end.
For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. He has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to our collective memory. To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.
For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
For where is the man that has incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds, or of the falsehood of all he condemns; or can say that he has examined to the bottom all his own, or other men's opinions? The necessity of believing without knowledge, nay often upon very slight grounds, in this fleeting state of action and blindness we are in, should make us more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain others.
For wordsmiths and masters of words, without necessarily being harsh with words, the words have a tendency to shoot straight to the hearts of people, and this either deeply touches them or deeply angers them. Like the apostles in all their loving controversies are those who are masters of words while combining this gift with truth.
For your past, for your flaws, and ultimately for your stress; I judge no one whom I've met along the way because in a sense we were all wounded in our own ways.

Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
Freedom has its life in the hearts, the actions, the spirit of men and so it must be daily earned and refreshed - else like a flower cut from its life-giving roots, it will wither and die.
Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.
Freedom is an absolute state, there is no such thing as being half-free.
Freedom is obedience to self-formulated rules.
Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.
Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.
Free jazz is so called because no-one would ever buy it.

Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief.
Friendship is the answer to happiness.
Friendship is the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words.
Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy like art... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give values to survival.
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring.

From the philosopher Catulus, never to be dismissive of a friend's accusation, even if it seems unreasonable, but to make every effort to restore the relationship to its normal condition.
From the scientific view, the theory of karma may be a metaphysical assumption -- but it is no more so than the assumption that all of life is material and originated out of pure chance
From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience, all evidence of truth.
From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

Frustration, although quite painful at times, is a very positive and essential part of success.
Functional programming is like describing your problem to a mathematician. Imperative programming is like giving instructions to an idiot.
Functional programming is to algorithms as the ubiquitous little black dress is to women's fashion.
Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him-mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.
Fun opens the doors to creativity, which then leads to inspiration, which then births passion, which all together equals both happiness and success!
Further, an excess of legislation defeats its own ends. It makes the whole population criminals, and turns them all into police and police spies. The moral health of such a people is ruined for ever; only revolution can save it.
Furthermore, as the body suffers the horrors of disease and the pangs of pain, so we see the mind stabbed with anguish, grief and fear. What more natural than that it should likewise have a share in death?
Future peace, prosperity and confidence depend not just on ourselves but on the success of all nations. Hence, we are all partners, no matter what our backgrounds, cultures, faiths and histories.

Give Obama a script he has made his own, and he is the motivational speaker to end all speakers. Tony Robbins cloned with Honest Abe.

Give up control. You never really had it anyway.
Give whatever you are doing and whoever you are with the gift of your attention.
Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are.
Giving connects two people, the giver and the receiver, and this connection gives birth to a new sense of belonging.
Giving importance to what we think because we thought it, taking our own selves not only (to quote the Greek philosopher) as the measure of all things but as their norm or standard, we create in ourselves, if not an interpretation, at least a criticism of the universe, which we don't even know and therefore cannot criticize. The giddiest, most weak-minded of us then promote that criticism to an interpretation that's superimposed, like a hallucination; induced rather than deduced. It's a hallucination in the strict sense, being an illusion based on something only dimly seen.
Giving is the only way of taking part
Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.
Go above and beyond your duty. You will benefit from it.
Go after what you want, as there's no time like the present.
Go ahead. Look out the window. Isn't it a beautiful day?
Go ahead, make my day.
Goals give you more than a reason to get up in the morning; they are an incentive to keep you going all day. Goals tend to tap the deeper resources and draw the best out of life.
Goals. There's not telling what you can do when you get inspired by them. There's no telling what you can do when you believe in them. There's no telling what will happen when you act upon them.

God gave us memory that we might have roses in December.
God gives us not only the truth but also the ability to believe it; not only the new thing to see but also the new eye to see it with.
God had faith in us to look after everything in and on the Earth. We just didn't have faith in ourselves to do it.
God has abandoned you. Fear does not serve you. Your heart has betrayed you. Only the music can guide you.
God has already done everything He's going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you're going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family.
God is a philosophical black hole -- the point where reason breaks down.
God is not a celestial prison warden jangling the keys on a bunch of lifers--he's a shepherd seeking for sheep, a woman searching for coins, a father waiting for his son.
God judges men from the inside out; men judge men from the outside in. Perhaps to God, an extreme mental patient is doing quite well in going a month without murder, for he fought his chemical imbalance and succeeded; oppositely, perhaps the healthy, able and stable man who has never murdered in his life yet went a lifetime consciously, willingly never loving anyone but himself may then be subject to harsher judgment than the extreme mental patient. It might be so that God will stand for the weak and question the strong.
God lets you be successful because he trusts you that you will do the right thing with it. Now, does he get disappointed often? All the time, because people get there and they forget how they got it.
God loves to help him who strives to help himself.
God must have a very good imagination because I would never have thought of a person like me.
Godshawk looked surprised, the way that people generally do when you ask them philosophical questions in shrubberies in the middle of the night.
God sleeps in the minerals, awakens in plants, walks in animals, and thinks in man.
God's pleasure--the beauty creation possesses in his regard--underlies the distinct being of creation, and so beauty is the first and truest word concerning all that appears within being; beauty is the showing of what is; God looked upon what he had wrought and saw that it was good.

Good-humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to say to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes us. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a smile.
Good ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate success for an athlete who possesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an overpriced pair of sneakers. Sports shoes don't win races. Athletes do.
Good ideas are out there for anyone with the wit and the will to find them.
Good is the enemy of great.
Good judgement comes with experience. Unfortunately, the experience usually comes from bad judgement.
Good man and bad man with money goes a long ways." ~ Amunhotep El Bey
Good men prefer to be accountable.

Good news is on its way.
Good people always find goodness in others.
Good planning is important. I've also regarded a sense of humor as one of the most important things on a big expedition. When you're in a difficult or dangerous situation, or when you're depressed about the chances of success, someone who can make you laugh eases the tension.

Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.
Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class -- whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.
Gracefulness has been defined to be the outward expression of the inward harmony of the soul.
Grace is the beauty of form under the influence of freedom.
Grammar and ordinary language are bad guides to metaphysics. A great book might be written showing the influence of syntax on philosophy.

Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.
Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.
Great changes may not happen right away, but with effort even the difficult may become easy.
Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
Great hopes make great men.

Great losses are great lessons.
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
Great minds have purposes, others have wishes.
Greatness is so often a courteous synonym for great success.
Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.
Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is cramped and busy. Great words are clear and limpid; little words are shrill and quarrelsome.

Growing up in a group home, and with an undiagnosed learning disability to boot, the odds of success were not on my side. But when I joined the high school football team, I learned the value of discipline, focus, persistence, and teamwork - all skills that have proven vital to my career as a C.E.O. and social entrepreneur.

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them
Guilt is a feeling that you owe a debt that you're not paying.
Guru and disciple do not meet accidentally, neither one becomes disciple by conversion only. In fact, there is always an ancient link maintained through many births nurtured and flowered with love and trust, with dedication and faithfulness, that which somehow gets revealed in this birth by meeting each other and finding that they were living in each other's soul always.

Health is hearty, health is harmony, health is happiness.
Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.
Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend. Non-being is the greatest joy.
Health is the natural condition. When sickness occurs, it is a sign that Nature has gone off course because of a physical or mental imbalance. The road to health for everyone is through moderation, harmony, and a 'sound mind in a sound body'.
Health, learning and virtue will ensure your happiness; they will give you a quiet conscience, private esteem and public honour.

He conquers who endures.
He could very likely have appealed for leniency. At least he could have saved his life by agreeing to leave Athens. But had he done this he would not have been Socrates. He valued his conscience--and the truth-- higher than life.
He did not wish to be divine. If there had never been a God, the emperor thought, it might have been easier to work out what goodness was. This business of worship, of the abnegation of self in the face of the Almighty, was a distraction, a false trail. Wherever goodness lay, it did not lie in ritual, unthinking obeisance before a deity but rather, perhaps, in the slow, clumsy, error-strewn working out of an individual or collective path.
He died that day because his body had served its purpose. His soul had done what it came to do, learned what it came to learn, and then was free to leave.
He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights.
He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much.
He is able who thinks he is able.
He is rich who is content with the least; for contentment is the wealth of nature.

He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will not escape. He must not merely wait for death, for then he will be a suicide, and will not escape. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it.
Hence the great irony: Hayek, one of the greatest champions of individual liberty and economic freedom the world has ever known, believed that knowledge was communal. Dewey, the champion of socialism and collectivism, believed that knowledge was individual. Hayek's is a philosophy that treats individuals as the best judges of their own self-interests, which in turn yield staggering communal cooperation. Dewey's was the philosophy of a giant, Monty Pythonesque crowd shouting on cue: "We're All Individuals!
Hence the sterile, uninspiring futility of a great many theoretical discussions of ethics, and the resentment which many people feel towards such discussions: moral principles remain in their minds as floating abstractions, offering them a goal they cannot grasp and demanding that they reshape their souls in its image, thus leaving them with a burden of undefinable moral guilt.
He recognized with absolute certainty the empty fragility of even the noblest theorizings as compared with the definitive plenitude of the smallest fact grasped in its total, concrete reality.
Herein lies the supreme wisdom, human and divine; and the task of philosophy consists in teaching men to submit joyously to Necessity which hears nothing and is indifferent to all.
Here is my final point. About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography and smoking and everything else. What business is it of yours what I do, read, buy, see, say, think, who I fuck, what I take into my body - as long as I do not harm another human being on this planet?
Here's Johnny!
Here's looking at you, kid.
Here we find further argument for Gotagga's supposition that the world is round. How else could all men stand higher than their brothers?
He's supposed to sound like he's in pain, he's a folk singer.
He stands erect by bending over the fallen. He rises by lifting others.
He stole glances at the heathen faces of Bodien and Gaylord, the suffering, yet oddly consoled, eyes and mouth of Basellecci, noting the brave enthusiasm of men who had never dreamed of anything very definite, and it occurred to him through the reek of his person that there was only one hope for him, and for all people who had lost, through intelligence, the hope of immortality. "We must love and delight in each other and in ourselves!" he cried.
He suddenly recalled from Plato's Symposium: People were hermaphrodites until God split then in two, and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost.
He that has patience may compass anything.
He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.
He understood well enough how a man with a choice between pride and responsibility will almost always choose pride if responsibility robs him of his manhood.
He walked on in silence, the solitary sound of his footsteps echoing in his head, as in a deserted street, at dawn. His solitude was so complete, beneath a lovely sky as mellow and serene as a good conscience, amid that busy throng, that he was amazed at his own existence; he must be somebody else's nightmare, and whoever it was would certainly awaken soon.
He was a great patriot, a humanitarian, a loyal friend; provided, of course, he really is dead.
He was a philosopher, if you know what that was.'
He was free, free in every way, free to behave like a fool or a machine, free to accept, free to refuse, free to equivocate; to marry, to give up the game, to drag this death weight about with him for years to come. He could do what he liked, no one had the right to advise him, there would be for him no Good or Evil unless he thought them into being.
He was still thoughtful. 'Do you think any of us ever really knows anyone?'
He whispered in her ears, "We will love each other forever."
He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.
He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal.
He who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior.
He who conquers others is strong, he who conquers himself is mighty.
He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg.
He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a despiser.
He who expects no gratitude shall never be disappointed.
He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.
He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.
He who gets the credits gets the blame.
He who has faith has... an inward reservoir of courage, hope, confidence, calmness, and assuring trust that all will come out well - even though to the world it may appear to come out most badly.
He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even himself--only in relation to his pupils.
He who is in harmony with the Tao
He who is mindless is defenceless"
He who is more mindful of one, loses the love and the faith of both.
He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing .
He who laughs last didn't understand the joke
He who says either that the time for philosophy has not yet come or that it has passed is like someone who says that the time for happiness has not yet come or that it has passed.
He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm.
He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.
He who wishes to secure the good of others, has already secured his own.
He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying.
He who writes well runs the civilization. Everyone else does the grunt work.
He will essentially follow the language of the spectacle, for it is the only one he is familiar with.
Hey, I am thinking of it myself, in this part of world (East), we all do endeavors in praying and are sweating (white liquid) and this is our situation, frustrated , but on the other part of world (West) ,they are enjoying in party and drinking liquor (white liquid) but their situation is that, successful, I do not know that the problem relates to the type of liquid or the way of drinking!!
High thoughts must have high language.
Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.
Hire people smarter than you. Work with people smarter than you. Listen to them. Let them lead you. Take the blame for all failures, give away the credit for all successes.
His conception of the universe is, however, instinctive, not intellectual; it can't be criticized as a concept, because there's none there, and it can't be criticized as temperament, because temperament can't be criticized.
His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to Him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to His power. If you choose to say, 'God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words, 'God can.' It remains true that all things are possible with God: the intrinsic impossibilities are not things but nonentities. It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of His creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.
His own life suddenly seemed repellently formal. Whom did he know or what did he know and whom did he love? Sitting on the stump under the burden of his father's death and even the mortality inherent in the dying, wildly colored canopy of leaves, he somehow understood that life was only what one did every day.... Nothing was like anything else, including himself, and everything was changing all of the time. He knew he couldn't perceive the change because he was changing too, along with everything else.
Historically, philosophy does not have an impressive track record of answering questions about natural world in a decisive manner.
Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle; natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend.
History is a hermaphrodite with many distinguished lovers. We are neither mysteries nor strangers but the living breath of revelation made flesh by the unrestrained desires of a free and universal love. Universal me. Universal you."
History is endured only by strong personalities -- the weak ones are extinguished by it.
Hitch your wagon to a star.
Hold fast to dreams. For if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.
Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody else expects of you, never excuse yourself.
Honest towards ourselves and towards anyone else who is our friend; brave towards the enemy; magnanimous towards the defeated; polite always: this is how the four cardinal virtues want us to act.
Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life - all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity.
Honesty and loyalty are key. If two people can be honest with each other about everything, that's probably the biggest key to success.
Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyway.
Honesty is the cornerstone of all success, without which confidence and ability to perform shall cease to exist.
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
Honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual, corporation, or product.
Honor has not to be won; it must only not be lost.
Hope burns eternal in the human heart.
Hope, deceitful though it be, is at least of this good use to us that while we are travelling through this life, it conducts us by an easier and more pleasant way to our journey's end.
Hope does not leave without being given permission.
Hopefully I'll continue to have the success I've had.
Hopefully, when people see 'Senna', they will understand why this inspirational story needed to be told, why it had to be made as a movie for the big screen, and why it is a film for everyone.
Hope is always available to us. When we feel defeated, we need only take a deep breath and say, "Yes," and hope will reappear.
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.
Hope is but the dream of those who wake.
Hope is some extraordinary spiritual grace that God gives us to control our fears, not to oust them.
Hope... is the companion of power, and the mother of success; for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles.
Hope is the dream of a soul awake.
Hope is the star that shines brighter in darker nights.
Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.
Hope will never be silent.
Houston, we have a problem.
How beautiful it could be if we woke up every morning with a burning desire to help others.
How can a country change if the people don't want to change their thoughts or lifestyle?
How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same?
How can a society that exists on instant mashed potatoes, packaged cake mixes, frozen dinners, and instant cameras teach patience to its young?
How can I be useful, of what service can I be? There is something inside me, what can it be?
How can I cast a vote, when I don't even cast a shadow?
How can I know for sure if it's my son speaking and not you?"
How can they say my life is not a success? Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten?
How can you not love this?
How charming is divine Philosophy!
How could someone possibly be that beautiful? She wondered for the hundred thousandth time. What higher power orchestrated such a perfect union of genes? Who decided that one single solitary soul deserved skin like that? It was so fundamentally unfair.(Chasing Harry Winston)
How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?
How does one measure the success of a museum?
How do we account for this paradox that the absence of Law universalizes prohibition ... The psychoanalytic name for this obscene injunction for this obscene call, ENJOY, is superego. The problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously enjoy. The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.
How do you know you're going to do something, untill you do it?
How do you tell when you run out of invisible ink?
How easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success.
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.
However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
However things may seem, no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure.
How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains!
How had they met? By chance, like everybody else. What were there names? What's it to you? Where were they coming from? From the nearest place. Where were they going? Does anyone really know where they're going?
How, in such an alien and inhuman world, can so powerless a creature as man preserve his aspirations untarnished? A strange mystery it is that nature, omnipotent but blind, in the revolutions of her secular hurryings through the abysses of space, has brought forth at last a child, subject still to her power, but gifted with sight, with knowledge of good and evil, with the capacity of judging all the works of his unthinking mother. In spite of death, the mark and seal of the parental control, man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine, to criticize, to know, and in imagination to create. To him alone, in the world with which he is aquainted, this freedom belongs; and in this lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his outward life.
How keen everyone is to make this world their home forgetting its impermanence It's like trying to see and name constellations in a fireworks display.
How little is required for pleasure! The sound of a bagpipe. Without music, life would be an error. The German imagines even God singing songs.
How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself.
How many of us have lately taken the time out to look at the sky; marvel at the clouds; smell the flowers; or smelt the fresh scent of rain; bought a stranger a cup of tea or coffee; given our time to help another; or just taken time out to sit and watch people rush hither and tither; said "I love you"; smiled at a complete stranger; joined in with kids from the street to play a game?
"How much conscience has had to chew on in the past! And what excellent teeth it had! And today--what is lacking?" A dentist's question.
How much evil throughout history could have been avoided had people exercised their moral acuity with convictional courage and said to the powers that be, 'No, I will not. This is wrong, and I don't care if you fire me, shoot me, pass me over for promotion, or call my mother, I will not participate in this unsavory activity.' Wouldn't world history be rewritten if just a few people had actually acted like individual free agents rather than mindless lemmings?
How small a thought it takes to fill a life.
How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do.
How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.
Human beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can change the outer aspects of their lives.
Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.
Human diversity makes tolerance more than a virtue; it makes it a requirement for survival.
Human history begins with man's act of disobedience which is at the very same time the beginning of his freedom and development of his reason.
Humanity must forgive 'Humanity', for only then can we be Humane.
Humankind has accumulated generation upon generation of knowledge, the culmination of which is the vast and useful technological array we see everywhere in modern society. Despite this great accumulation of knowledge and technology, we still suffer from starvation and war. The difference between the past and the present is the difference between throwing rocks and shooting missiles. We are still in conflict. Suffering on a fundamental level hasn't ceased. But we nevertheless persist in the notion that if we just amass a bit more knowledge, we'll all be o.k. Maybe a new philosophy will do the trick, or a new system of government. But all of this has been tried many times.
Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.
Humility is the true key to success. Successful people lose their way at times. They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits of success. Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap. Humble people share the credit and wealth, remaining focused and hungry to continue the journey of success.
Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them.
Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.
Humor has bailed me out of more tight situations than I can think of. If you go with your instincts and keep your humor, creativity follows. With luck, success comes, too.
Humor is mankind's greatest blessing.
I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples.
I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of, Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough.
I always envisioned myself being a rapper and being in the game and having success, but you never know what it feels like or how you're going to be when you're there.
I always like a woman in power in politics. I think they're pretty inspirational in terms of looks to begin with. It's very calculated.
I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter.
I always say be humble but be firm. Humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs.
I always thought old age would be a writer's best chance. Whenever I read the late work of Goethe or W. B. Yeats I had the impertinence to identify with it. Now, my memory's gone, all the old fluency's disappeared. I don't write a single sentence without saying to myself, 'It's a lie!' So I know I was right. It's the best chance I've ever had.
I always win. Except when I lose, but then I just don't count it.
I am a citizen of the world.
"I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you."
I am an enthusiast, but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine. I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success.
I am an i poet.
I am a part of all that I have met.
I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man. I am an unpleasant man. I think my liver is diseased. However, I don't know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me. I don't treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let's say sufficiently so to respect medicine. (I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.) No, I refuse to treat it out of spite. You probably will not understand that. Well, but I understand it. Of course I can't explain to you just whom I am annoying in this case by my spite. I am perfectly well aware that I cannot "get even" with the doctors by not consulting them. I know better than anyone that I thereby injure only myself and no one else. But still, if I don't treat it, its is out of spite. My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!
I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.
I am a success because I do my best before I rest.
I am beautiful because the kindness of my heart is beautiful.
I am big! It's the pictures that got small.
I am convinced that America's great sea of goodwill can be, in fact, a rising tide, a tide that could lift every veteran and every family of our wounded and fallen.
I am dead because I lack desire,
I am decidedly of the opinion that in very many instances we can trace such a necessary connexion, especially among birds, and often with more complete success than in the case which I have here attempted to explain.
I am deliberate and afraid of nothing.
I am fully aware that everybody has a right to succeed, and success should be with ethics.
I am happy for who I am, and what I have come to be. I look forward to whatever else that may come with positivity.
I am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to Laker success.
I am hitting my head against the walls, but the walls are giving way.
I am in this same river. I can't much help it. I admit it: I'm racist. The other night I saw a group (or maybe a pack?) or white teenagers standing in a vacant lot, clustered around a 4x4, and I crossed the street to avoid them; had they been black, I probably would have taken another street entirely. And I'm misogynistic. I admit that, too. I'm a shitty cook, and a worse house cleaner, probably in great measure because I've internalized the notion that these are woman's work. Of course, I never admit that's why I don't do them: I always say I just don't much enjoy those activities (which is true enough; and it's true enough also that many women don't enjoy them either), and in any case, I've got better things to do, like write books and teach classes where I feel morally superior to pimps. And naturally I value money over life. Why else would I own a computer with a hard drive put together in Thailand by women dying of job-induced cancer? Why else would I own shirts mad in a sweatshop in Bangladesh, and shoes put together in Mexico? The truth is that, although many of my best friends are people of color (as the cliche goes), and other of my best friends are women, I am part of this river: I benefit from the exploitation of others, and I do not much want to sacrifice this privilege. I am, after all, civilized, and have gained a taste for "comforts and elegancies" which can be gained only through the coercion of slavery. The truth is that like most others who benefit from this deep and broad river, I would probably rather die (and maybe even kill, or better, have someone kill for me) than trade places with the men, women, and children who made my computer, my shirt, my shoes.
I am mad for You,
I am mad for You, it doesn't need not to be proved.
I am Me. In all the world, there is no one else exactly like me. Everything that comes out of me is authentically mine, because I alone chose it -- I own everything about me: my body, my feelings, my mouth, my voice, all my actions, whether they be to others or myself. I own my fantasies, my dreams, my hopes, my fears. I own my triumphs and successes, all my failures and mistakes. Because I own all of me, I can become intimately acquainted with me. By so doing, I can love me and be friendly with all my parts. I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me, and other aspects that I do not know -- but as long as I am friendly and loving to myself, I can courageously and hopefully look for solutions to the puzzles and ways to find out more about me. However I look and sound, whatever I say and do, and whatever I think and feel at a given moment in time is authentically me. If later some parts of how I looked, sounded, thought, and felt turn out to be unfitting, I can discard that which is unfitting, keep the rest, and invent something new for that which I discarded. I can see, hear, feel, think, say, and do. I have the tools to survive, to be close to others, to be productive, and to make sense and order out of the world of people and things outside of me. I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and I am Okay.
I am my world.
I am never without my lyric book. If anything inspirational happens, I have it there so nothing's forgotten.
I am not afraid... I was born to do this.
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.
I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today!
I am not a has-been. I am a will be.
I am not always capable of expressing myself to you, but I can always feel your deep desires.
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
I am not a vegetarian because I love animals; I am a vegetarian because I hate plants.
I am not the hope, neither is any other historical, imaginary or mythical savior. What am I! Nothing. As far as your life is concerned, I am no more valuable and holy than the particles of dust under your feet. So, I have nothing to give you. Only you my friend, can define, understand and manifest religion within yourself.
I am not young enough to know everything.
I am one thing, my writings are another.
I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.
I am philosophical Christ; crucified on the cross of ignorance for the sake of
I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil's attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth.
I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.
I am serving the purpose for which I was designed, therefore I am satisfied with my existence.
I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and again 'I know that that's a tree', pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell him: 'This fellow isn't insane. We are only doing philosophy.
I am so fresh in soul and spirit that life gushes and bubbles around me in a thousand springs.
I am stable when my private life is a success.
I am very conscious of who I am as an artist and as an inspirational person.
I am very optimistic, and I wish that God almighty grants me success to get a qualifying time. Only then can I go to the Olympics. If this happens I will be the first Palestinian athlete to gain a qualifying time. This will be a big achievement.
I am what some would say 'holy, and wholly other than you.' The problem is that many folks try to grasp some sense of who I am by taking the best version of themselves, projecting that to the nth degree, factoring in all the goodness they can perceive, which often isn't much, and then call that God. And while it may seem like a noble effort, the truth is that it falls pitifully short of who I really am. I'm not merely the best version of you that you can think of. I am far more than that, above and beyond all that you can ask or think.
I am your father.
I appreciate people who are civil, whether they mean it or not. I think: Be civil. Do not cherish your opinion over my feelings. There's a vanity to candor that isn't really worth it. Be kind.
I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties.
I arise full of eagerness and energy, knowing well what achievement lies ahead of me.
I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage
I attribute my success to my mental approach to the game. I have always been a serious student of umpiring. I enjoy studying rules, situations, and positioning.
I attribute my success to this - I never gave or took any excuse.
I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.
I avoid clich�s like the plague.
I bargained with Life for a penny,
I believed that I was approaching the end of my days without having tasted to the full any of the pleasures for which my heart thirsted...without having ever tasted that passion which, through lack of an object, was always suppressed. ...The impossibility of attaining the real persons precipitated me into the land of chimeras; and seeing nothing that existed worthy of my exalted feelings, I fostered them in an ideal world which my creative imagination soon peopled with beings after my own heart.
I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine.
I believe in God because I can see the beauty and the love in you.
I believe in living today. Not in yesterday, nor in tomorrow.
I believe in luck: how else can you explain the success of those you dislike?
I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.
I believe in political solutions to political problems. But man's primary problems aren't political; they're philosophical. Until humans can solve their philosophical problems, they're condemned to solve their political problems over and over and over again. It's a cruel, repetitious bore.
I believe in spectacles, but I think eyes necessary too.
I believe in the city as a natural human environment, but we must humanize it. It's art that will re-define public space in the 21st Century. We can make our cities diverse, inspirational places by putting art, dance and performance in all its forms into the matrix of street life.
I believe in the dignity of labor, whether with head or hand; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I believe it is in my nature to dance by virtue of the beat of my heart, the pulse of my blood and the music in my mind.
I believe success is preparation, because opportunity is going to knock on your door sooner or later but are you prepared to answer that?
I believe that any type of education can be great, but an education about ourselves can create something wonderful. I am a comedian, but people have called me a motivational speaker. I don't really consider myself that at all.
I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy.
I believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life. You can't truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles.
I believe that friends are quiet angels who sit on our shoulders and lift our wings when we forget how to fly.
I believe that if one always looked at the skies, one would end up with wings.
I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be moved to act.
I believe that just because something didn't go the way you planned it once, it's no reason not to try again.
I believe that one defines oneself by reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself. To cut yourself out of stone.
I believe that one key to success is to accept truth, no matter how it's spoken.
I believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world. I believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely us.
I believe that the only courage anybody ever needs is the courage to follow your own dreams.
I believe that the universe was formed around 15 billion years ago and that humans have evolved from their apelike ancestors over the past few million years. I believe we are more likely to live a good life if all humans try to work together in a world community, preserving planet earth. When decisions for groups are made in this world, I believe that the democratic process should be used. To protect the individual, I believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, freedom of inquiry, and a wall of separation between church and state. When making decisions about what is right or wrong, I believe I should use my intelligence to reason about the likely consequences of my actions. I believe that I should try to increase the happiness of everyone by caring for other people and finding ways to cooperate. Never should my actions discriminate against people simply because of their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, or national origin. I believe that ideas about what is right and wrong will change with education, so I am prepared to continually question ideas using evidence from experience and science. I believe there is no valid evidence to support claims for the existence of supernatural entities and deities. I will use these beliefs to guide my thinking and my actions until I find good reasons for revising them or replacing them with other beliefs that are more valid.
I believe there are three keys to success. For me it is keeping my priorities in order: It's my faith and my family, and then the business.
I believe there's an inner power that makes winners or losers. And the winners are the ones who really listen to the truth of their hearts.
I blame everything on LIFE!
I came to America with a dream and I made it. The dream became reality. America is built for success.
I can accept anything, except what seems to be the easiest for most people: the half-way, the almost, the just-about, the in-between.
I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.
I can and I will. Watch me.
I can blend words easily with my pen, and show concepts from deep within. Yet not everyone gets the message I send. So why do I even let these words begin? Maybe they will soak in one day at the right time. When the readers on a new path to find. So for now I'll continue to drop ink and not worry about what other people think.
I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome.
I can kill a bad guy, but I can't save anyone. I'm not a hero. All I am is a killer. A dead killer who shit his pants.
I can live for two months on a good compliment.
I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect.
I cannot encourage any fabrication even for the sake of making people feel good. If I were to fabricate consciously and knowingly, I would not only be ordaining myself their enemy, but also ordaining myself God's enemy.
I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.
I cannot help you, for I am just a cookie.
I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better.
I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think
I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.
I can say the willingness to get dirty has always defined us as an nation, and it's a hallmark of hard work and a hallmark of fun, and dirt is not the enemy.
I can't be who I'm not, but I can be who I am.
I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
I can, therefore I am.
I can't hold my liquor, but I can definitely hold a tune.
I can't make predictions and I never will
I can't sleep on a bed of discontent.
I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I'm frightened of the old ones.
I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.
I celebrate myself, and sing myself.
I choose to make the rest of my life the best of my life.
I come to win.
I congratulate you, my brave countrymen and fellow soldiers, on the spirit and success with which you have executed this important part of our enterprise.
I consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine, because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves.
I consist of body and soul - in the worlds of a child. And why shouldn't we speak like children? But the enlightened, the knowledgealbe would say: I am body through and through, nothing more; and the soul is just a word for something on the body.
I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies.
I count life just a stuff, to try the soul's strength on.
Ideas and philosophies have a shelf-life. They must be kept fresh and renewed or they will spoil. If left unattended, the same ideas and philosophies that once nourished you and helped you grow can poison you and make you sick. Become aware of new ideas that can refresh your way of life and be open to the fact that your old ideas and philosophies can work for you for some time, but when the shelf-life has passed, those ideas and philosophies could also harm you.
Ideas are a dime a dozen. People who implement them are priceless.
Ideas are the source of all things
Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open the door is just one more good idea.
Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.
Ideas shape the course of history.
I define success as being comfortable with yourself and your life. And that is about as good as it gets, really.
I demolish my bridges behind me...then there is no choice but to move forward.
Identifying the flaw in the US philosophical roots requires that we move beyond the intellectual and emotional climate in which the Constitution was conceived and adopted. The meanings of concepts and words change with use, and even the Supreme Court has admitted that the original perspective of the American social contract has been altered by the passage of time.
I desire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under the motto 'to live well you must live unseen
I did an A Level in Theatre Studies and had a really inspirational teacher, and then I just went on to university.
I didn't fail the test. I just found 100 ways to do it wrong.
I didn't say it was your fault. I said I was going to blame you.
I didn't want to do it,' Kiala said. 'The universe just kind of conspired to force me to make a fool of myself. It does that quite a lot, actually.
I did stand-up comedy for 18 years. Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four years were spent in wild success. I was seeking comic originality, and fame fell on me as a byproduct. The course was more plodding than heroic.
"I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.
I discovered at a very early age that if I talked for long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So, either I'm God, or truth is relative. Eitherway, booyah.
I discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we have to believe in something which has no form and no color--something which exists before all forms and colors appear... No matter what god or doctrine you believe in, if you become attached to it, your belief will be based more or less on a self-centered idea.
"I dislike him."--Why?--"I am not a match for him."--Did any one ever answer so?
Idleness is the beginning of all psychology. What? Should psychology be a vice?
I'd like to be the moon in your sky.
I'd like to one day be featured on a list of inspirational people who have made a difference in the world, whether it be helping underprivileged people or putting an end to the poaching of wildlife in Africa.
I do a lot of inspirational talks for kids, to motivate them to change their lives and give them hope.
I do like alternative rock and rap, but as far as inspirational, then I go full-on orchestra. It fills up your entire being.
I do love to eavesdrop. It's inspirational, not only for subject matter but for actual dialogue, the way people talk.
I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but it should get you pretty near.
I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.
I do not know how to teach philosophy without becoming a disturber of the peace.
I do not know what the heart of a rascal may be, but I know what is in the heart of an honest man; it is horrible.
I do not like to repeat successes, I like to go on to other things.
I do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature.
I do not think that tragedy is our natural fate and I do not live in chronic dread of disaster. It is no happiness, but suffering that I consider unnatural. It is not success, but calamity that I regard as the abnormal exception in Human Life.
I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.
I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.
I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.
I don't count my sit-ups; I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count.
I don't cry tears for the people I've lost, but for the people that I don't know.
I don't deserve a soul, yet I still have one. I know because it hurts.
I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.
I don't dwell on success. Maybe that's one reason I'm successful.
I don't have a philosophy: I have senses...
I don't imitate; I just emulate.
I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.
I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure. He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.
I don't know what keeps me going. Sometimes I wonder... I think it's just pure perseverance and wanting to succeed and having that burning desire to always have success.
I don't know what's worse: to not know what you are and be happy, or to become what you've always wanted to be, and feel alone.
I don't know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I cannot know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it.
I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.
I don't like being choreographed to a T. I like to take steps and make them my own.
I don't like the ALPHAbet. I'm going to wait for the BETA version.
I don't look to jump over 7-foot bars-I look for 1-foot bars that I can step over.
I don't lose any sleep at night over the potential for failure. I cannot even spell the word.
I don't measure a man's success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom.
I don't need to be
i don't regret the difficulties I experienced; I think they help helped me to become the person I am today. i feel the way a warrior must feel after years of traning; he doesn't remember the details of everything he learned, but he knows how to strike when the time is right
I don't stop when I am tired, I stop when I am done.
I don't suffer from insanity, I enjoy every minute of it.
I don't take success and failure seriously. The only thing I do seriously is march forward. If I fall, I get up and march again.
I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success.
I don't think 'Cocktail' was a perfect critical success, but it touched a vein in our culture.
I don't think journalists in World War II were objective about the Nazis, and I don't think they should have been.
I don't think the real America is in New York or on the Pacific Coast; personally, I like the Middle West much better, places like North and South Dakota, Minneapolis and Saint Paul. There, I think, are the true Americans
I don't want to accidentally end up looking back on my life to find that I'm ashamed of myself, I want to live a life I can be proud of.
I don't want to be a tree; I want to be its meaning.
I don't want to be married to someone who feels inferior to my success or because I make more money than he does.
I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I lived just the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well.
I don't want to survive. I want to live.
I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail, than to attempt nothing and succeed.
I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
I'd rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate.
I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.
I'd rather write programs to write programs than write programs.
I drink cup of sunlight every morning to brighten myself.
I drink your milkshake!
I dwell in possibility.
If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?
If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.

If a man does his best, what else is there?
If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.
If a man does not know what port he is steering for, no wind is favourable to him.
If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life, he will soon find himself left alone. A man, Sir, should keep his friendship in constant repair.
If a man has any greatness in him, it comes to light, not in one flamboyant hour, but in the ledger of his daily work.
If a man has been his mother's undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling, the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.
If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs.
If a man who can't count finds a four leaf clover, is he lucky?
If an angelic being fell from the sky and tried to live in this world of ours I think even they would commit many wrongs.
If an apology is followed by an excuse or a reason, it means they are going to commit same mistake again they just apologized for.
If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.
If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, "He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.

If a woman has manly virtues, one feels like running away; and if she has no manly virtues, she herself runs away.
If a woman has to choose between catching a fly ball and saving an infant's life, she will choose to save the infant's life without even considering if there are men on base.
If a writer falls in love with you, you can never die.
if being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and this is impossible, for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like
If by any chance a playwright wishes to express a political opinion or a moral opinion or a philosophy, he must be a good enough craftsman to do it with so much spice of entertainment in it that the public get the message without being aware of it.
If chance be the Father of all flesh,
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
If disaster, so be it, they said to themselves. There was nothing to be done except what could be done. The rest -- like the salt water around them, which swallowed the snow without effort, remaining what it was implacably -- was out of their hands, beyond.
I feel it is everybody's obligation to reach for the best in themselves and use that for the interest of mankind.
I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started.
I feel lucky because I was a nerd, which I talk about in the book, but I had academic success, so through that, because that's what my parents put a great deal of value on, I had a great childhood because I sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school.
I felt the taste of mortality in my mouth, and at that moment I understood that I was not going to live forever. It takes a long time to learn that, but when you finally do, everything changes inside you, you can never be the same again. I was seventeen years old, and all of a sudden, without the slightest flicker of a doubt, I understood that my life was my own, that it belonged to me and no one else.
If everyone is a product of this society, who will say the things that need to be said, and do the things that need to be done, without compromise? Truth will never start out popular in a world more concerned with marketability than righteousness. It will initially suffer ridicule and even violence- yet ultimately it is undeniable. All of humanity is living in a dream world, but suffering real consequences.
If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.
If everyone wants to be somebody, I want to be somebody else
If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough.
If everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.
If he was not exactly a Spartan, he was, you might say, spartanatical. Things happened to you; they were good,or they were bad - and that was the truth about everything.
If I am godless it is because I have not found my soulmate as yet.
If I could offer but one helpful hint to young Hoosiers hoping to better their odds for success in life, I would simply note the importance of thoughtful reading.
If I create from the heart, nearly everything works; if from the head, almost nothing.
If i had it all to do again there would be more bodies.
If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any way in which I would ever have made progress.
If I had to live my life over, I'd live over a saloon.
If I have made a mistake in the design, then I'm the one who should pay for it. I certainly would not ask somebody else to fly a plane if I were afraid to do it myself.
If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.
If I hold my head to the left and look down at the handle grips and front wheel and map carrier and gas tank I get one pattern of sense data. If I move my head to the right I get another slightly different pattern of sense data. The two views are different. The angles of the planes and curves of the metal are different. The sunlight strikes them differently. If there's no logical basis for substance then there's no logical basis for concluding that what's produced these two views is the same motorcycle.
I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.
I find television very educational. Every time someone switches it on I go into another room and read a good book.
I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.
I find that when you have a real interest in life and a curious life, that sleep is not the most important thing.
I firmly believe that unless one has tasted the bitter pill of failure, one cannot aspire enough for success.
If I speak in anger, then you must listen in silence.
If it boils and is watched, it can't be a pot.
If I tell you I'm good, you would probably think I'm boasting. If I tell you I'm no good, you know I'm lying.
If it is bread that you seek, you will have bread.
If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger.

If men could combine thus earnestly, and patiently, and harmoniously to some really worthy end, what might they not accomplish?
If my opinion that substance requires a true unity were founded only on a definition I had formulated in opposition to common usage, *then the dispute would be only one of words*. But besides the fact that most philosophers have taken the term in almost the same fashion, distinguishing between a unity in itself and an accidental unity, between substantial and accidental form, and between perfect and imperfect, natural and artificial mixtures, I take things to a much higher level, and setting aside the question of terminology, *I believe that where there are only beings by aggregation, there aren't any real beings*. For every being by aggregation presupposes beings endowed with real unity, because every being derives its reality only from the reality of those beings of which it is composed, so that it will not have any reality at all if each being of which it is composed is itself a being by aggregation, a being for which we must still seek further grounds for its reality, grounds which can never be found in this way, if we must always continue to seek for them. I agree, Sir, that there are only machines (that are often animated) in all of corporeal nature, but I do not agree that *there are only aggregates of substances, there must also be true substances from which all the aggregates result.
If my writing comes to a halt, I head to the shops: I find them very inspirational. And if I get into real trouble with my plot, I go out for a pizza with my husband.
If nothing comes to mind................
If once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he next comes to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination.
If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.
If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again.
If one knew the truth how could there be freedom? If hell and paradise were in the middle of the marketplace, everyone would be a saint.
If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty.
If one synchronized swimmer drowns, do the rest have to drown too?
If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty.
If only it were possible to love without injury -- fidelity isn't enough: I had been faithful to Anne and yet I had injured her. The hurt is in the act of possession: we are too small in mind and body to possess another person without pride or to be possessed without humiliation. In a way I was glad that my wife had struck out at me again -- I had forgotten her pain for too long, and this was the only kind of recompense I could give her. Unfortunately the innocent are always involved in any conflict. Always, everywhere, there is some voice crying from a tower.
If only people would realize that moral principles are like measles...They have to be caught. And only the people who've got them can pass on the contagion.
If only you would realize some day, how much have you hurt me,
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.
If people are not laughing at your goals, your goals are too small.
If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do.

If Relativity Theory kills our deepest convictions, why not start by finding out why we believed in them for millennia?
If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action, I shall gladly change. I seek the truth, which never harmed anyone: the harm is to persist in one's own self-deception and ignorance.
If someone says 'grunge' or 'punk,' you know what the sound is, but if you say 'No Wave,' it's kind of mysterious. That was the most interesting part and should have been the most inspirational thing about it... here's this collective sonic insanity, and none of it sounds anything alike.
If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.
If something isn't working, you need to look back and figure out what got you excited in the first place.

If the game is rigged so you can't win, find another game or invent your own.
If the meaning of life has become doubtful, if one's relations to others and to oneself do not offer security, then fame is one means to silence one's doubts. It has a function to be compared with that of the Egyptian pyramids or the Christian faith in immortality: it elevates one's individual life from its limitations and instability to the plane of indestructability; if one's name is known to one's contemporaries and if one can hope that it will last for centuries, then one's life has meaning and significance by this very reflection of it in the judgments of others.
If the moment is everthing, then everything is time.
If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.
If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons.
If there are no struggles, there is no progress.
If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.
If there is a will, there is a way.
If there is no struggle, there is no progress.
If the rest of your brain were conscious, it would probably regard you as the pointy-haired boss from Dilbert
If there were a party of those who aren't sure they're right, I'd belong to it.
If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair?
If there were no night, we would not appreciate the day, nor could we see the stars and the vastness of the heavens. We must partake of the bitter with the sweet. There is a divine purpose in the adversities we encounter every day. They prepare, they purge, they purify, and thus they bless.
If the sum of living be love's fee,

If the worker and his boss enjoy the same television program and visit the same resort places, if the typist is as attractively made up as the daughter of her employer, if the Negro owns a Cadillac, if they all read the same newspaper, then this assimilation indicates not the disappearance of classes, but the extent to which the needs and satisfactions that serve the preservation of the Establishment are shared by the underlying population.
If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it.

If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking.
If we are in a general way permitted to regard human activity in the realm of the beautiful as a liberation of the soul, as a release from constraint and restriction, in short to consider that art does actually alleviate the most overpowering and tragic catastrophes by means of the creations it offers to our contemplation and enjoyment, it is the art of music which conducts us to the final summit of that ascent to freedom.
If we are merely matter intricately assembled, is this really demeaning? If there's nothing here but atoms, does that make us less or does that make matter more?
If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being?
If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves.

If we don't want to change ourselves, how can we expect progress and abundance?
...if we gained only one incontestable truth every ten years from each of our philosophical writers the harvest we reaped would be sufficient.
If we get our self-esteem from superficial places, from our popularity, appearance, business success, financial situation, health, any of these, we will be disappointed, because no one can guarantee that we'll have them tomorrow.
If we have our own why of life, we shall get along with almost any how. Man does not strive for pleasure; only the Englishman does.
If we look at the world with a love of life, the world will reveal its beauty to us.
If we look through the aperture which we have opened up onto the absolute, what we see there is a rather menacing power--something insensible, and capable of destroying both things and worlds, of bringing forth monstrous absurdities, yet also of never doing anything, of realizing every dream, but also every nightmare, of engendering random and frenetic transformations, or conversely, of producing a universe that remains motionless down to its ultimate recesses, like a cloud bearing the fiercest storms, then the eeriest bright spells, if only for an interval of disquieting calm. We see an omnipotence equal to that of the Cartesian God, and capable of anything, even the inconceivable; but an omnipotence that has become autonomous, without norms, blind, devoid of the other divine perfections, a power with neither goodness nor wisdom, ill-disposed to reassure thought about the veracity of its distinct ideas. We see something akin to Time, but a Time that is inconceivable for physics, since it is capable of destroying without cause or reason, every physical law, just as it is inconceivable for metaphysics, since it is capable of destroying every determinate entity, even a god, even God. This is not a Heraclitean time, since it is not the eternal law of becoming, but rather the eternal and lawless possible becoming of every law. It is a Time capable of destroying even becoming itself by bringing forth, perhaps forever, fixity, stasis, and death.
If we put away all the etymological jargon and destroy all self-created images and technical descriptions, then it is as simple as this - a moral being is a good being - a religious being - a conscientious being - a wise being.
If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones.
If we try to measure Now, we find it's always gone, has become part of the past.

If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as lines produced but as lines spent.
If we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.

If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year.

If you know how to be happy with the wonders of life that are already there for you to enjoy, you don't need to stress your mind and your body by striving harder and harder, and you don't need to stress this planet by purchasing more and more stuff. The Earth belongs to our children. We have already borrowed too much from it, from them; and the way things have been going, we're not sure we'll be able to give it back to them in decent shape. And who are our children, actually? They are us, because they are our own continuation. So we've been shortchanging our own selves. Much of our modern way of life is permeated by mindless overborrowing. The more we borrow, the more we loser. That's why it's critical that we wake up and see we don't need to do that anymore. What's already available in the here and now is plenty for us to be nourished, to be happy. Only that kind of insight will get us, each one of us, to stop engaging in the compulsive, self-sabotaging behaviors of our species. We need a collective awakening. One Buddha is not enough. All of us have to become Buddhas in order for our planet to have a chance. Fortunately, we have the power to wake up, to touch enlightenment from moment to moment, in our very own ordinary and, yes, busy lives. So let's start right now. Peace is your every breath.

Your doctor will be right, and so will mine at my next office visit. Elevate, folk! Elevate your mind, your soul, and your leg, in the order needed!

If you've a notion of what man's heart is, wouldn't you say that maybe the whole effort of man on earth to build a civilization is simply man's frantic and frightened attempt to hide himself from himself? That there is a part of man that man wants to reject? That man wants to keep from knowing what he is? That he wants to protect himself from seeing that he is something awful? And that this 'awful' part of himself might not be as awful as he thinks, but he finds it too strange and he does not know what to do with it? We talk about what to do with the atom bomb...But man's heart, his spirit is the deadliest thing in creation. Are not all cultures and civilizations just screens which men have used to divide themselves, to put between that part of themselves which they are afraid of and that part of themselves which they wish, in their deep timidity, to try to preserve? Are not all of man's efforts at order an attempt to still man's fear of himself?

I get invited to many more literary festivals than I used to because I'm associated with 'Slumdog Millionaire,' the brand. Many more doors have opened up for me as a result of the global success of the film, although I believe that I'm the same person that existed before it.

I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it. But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.
I grew up in a very spiritual home in a Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, FL. I was raised in the church, and my mother was a very inspirational person in my life.
I grew up once, I decided never to do it again
I guess, when you're drunk, every woman looks beautiful and every language looks (like) a Lisp :)
I guess when you turn off the main road, you have to be prepared to see some funny houses.
I had a microscopic eye for the blemish, for the grain of ugliness which to me constituted the sole beauty of the object.
I had an inspirational teacher at my junior school: Peter Nixon. He was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and slightly scary - a good combination for a teacher.
I had hoped when my life was chronicled, it would be an inspirational story.
I had to learn how to teach less, so that more could be learned.
I had to philosophize. Otherwise, I could not live in this world.
I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.'
I hated every minute of training, but I said, "Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.
I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.
I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success.
I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say "look how beautiful it is," and I'll agree. Then he says "I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing," and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.
I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.
I have always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
I have always thought that all philosophical debates are ultimately between the partisans of structure and the partisans of "goo.
I have amazing friends who have led inspirational lives.
I have an idea of who I want to be, I have a vision of my own success.
I have a sadness within my happiness.
I have a sickness doctors can't cure,
I have a simple philosophy: whenever possible, help those who need it the most.
I have a tendency to sabotage relationships; I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts.
I have been accused of a habit of changing my opinions. I am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions. What physicist who was already active in 1900 would dream of boasting that his opinions had not changed during the last half century? In science men change their opinions when new knowledge becomes available; but philosophy in the minds of many is assimilated rather to theology than to science. The kind of philosophy that I value and have endeavoured to pursue is scientific, in the sense that there is some definite knowledge to be obtained and that new discoveries can make the admission of former error inevitable to any candid mind. For what I have said, whether early or late, I do not claim the kind of truth which theologians claim for their creeds. I claim only, at best, that the opinion expressed was a sensible one to hold at the time when it was expressed. I should be much surprised if subsequent research did not show that it needed to be modified. I hope, therefore, that whoever uses this dictionary will not suppose the remarks which it quotes to be intended as pontifical pronouncements, but only as the best I could do at the time towards the promotion of clear and accurate thinking. Clarity, above all, has been my aim.
I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.
I have been up against tough competition all my life. I wouldn't know how to get along without it.
I have brought peace to this land, and security," he began.
'I have done my best.' That is about all the philosophy of living one needs.
I have forgotten my umbrella.
I have given up anarchy. Too many rules - hating the government and all that stuff.
I have gone around observing your activities from the outside. Because of this I have also been able to see things to which you have been blind... Every morning you have gone to work, but you have never been fully awake. Of course, you have seen the sun and the moon, the stars in the sky, and everything that moves, but you haven't really seen it at all. It is different for the Joker, because he was put into this world with a flaw: He sees too clearly and too much.
I have gone from being a 21-year-old with wide eyes to a 24-year-old woman. With success comes a lot of responsibility and power.
I have had all of the disadvantages required for success.
I have had success throughout the years. Some of the hard rock bands today don't have the history that I have.
I have learned over the years that when one's mind is made up, this diminishes fear.
I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed.
I have learned to be a friend to myself Great improvement this indeed Such a one can never be said to be alone for know that he who is a friend to himself is a friend to all mankind
I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world.
I have looked into your eyes with my eyes. I have put my heart near your heart.
I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them.
I have more love, success, and security than I could ever dream of.
I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him.
I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars." Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. . . . Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. . . . There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.
I have no desire for others to take it on themselves to analyze my thoughts. I am without thoughts. I have never, not even once, acted on the basis of any doctrine or philosophy.I am convinced that those people whom the world considers good and respects are all liars and fakes. I do not trust the world.
I have no greater desire than to taste your lips on mine.
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
I have nothing to give away except my love and my ideas.
I have no time for those who say there is no way Scotland could go it alone. I know first-hand the contribution Scotland and Scots make to Britain's success - so for me there's no question about whether Scotland could be an independent nation.
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.
I hold strongly to this: that it is better to be impetuous than circumspect; because fortune is a woman and if she is to be submissive it is necessary to beat and coerce her.
I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
I hope it is not necessary for me to stress the platonic nature of our relationship- not platonic in the purest sense, there was no philosophical discourse, but we certainly didn't fuck, which is usually what people mean by platonic; which I bet would really piss Plato off, that for all his thinking and chatting his name has become an adjective for describing sexless trysts.
I hope that at the end of the seven years, people will say that I have been of some inspirational value to them at home in terms of inclusiveness and abroad, I look forward to representing Ireland.
I imagine that the intelligent people are the ones so intelligent that they don't even need or want to look 'intelligent' anymore.
I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.
I just don't live life.
Ik kwam er achter dat ik er mijn hele leven heus niet naar had verlang om te leven - als wat anderen doen tenminste leven genoemd kan worden - maar wel om mezelf te kunnen uitdrukken.
I knew all the rules but the rules did not know me.
I knew a man who gave twenty years of his life to a scatterbrained woman, sacrificing everything to her, his friendships, his work, the very respectability of his life and who one evening recognized that he had never loved her. He had been bored, thats all, bored like most people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama. Something must happen and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen even loveless slavery, even war or death.
I knew I was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before.
I knew, regardless of anything else, singing in front of an orchestra was going to be inspirational. It would feed me.
I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying.
I know how men in exile feed on dreams of hope.
I know not age, nor weariness nor defeat.
I know of no single formula for success. But over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together.
I know that pain is the most important thing in the universes. Greater than survival, greater than love, greater even than the beauty it brings about. For without pain, there can be no pleasure. Without sadness, there can be no happiness. Without misery there can be no beauty. And without these, life is endless, hopeless, doomed and damned.
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: 'Have you HEARD THIS?
I know that when I like music, when it touches my heart, that it will touch your heart, too. That, I think, is the secret to my success.
I know the price of success: dedication, hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.
I know where I'm going and I know the truth, and I don't have to be what you want me to be. I'm free to be what I want.
I know why I am here and my only real focused goal is to live each day to the fullest and to try and honor God and be an encouragement to others. What the future holds is firmly in God's hands, and I am very happy about that!
I know you've heard it a thousand times before. But it's true--hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don't love something, then don't do it.
I learned pretty soon that it was essential to fail and be foolish.
I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.
I like Dancing of Indian girls more than my parents' prayers . Because they dance with love and passion . But my parents just say their prayers because they got used to it .
I like legs that go all the way to the penthouse.
I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.
I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don't accept your limitations, jump before you're pushed, leap before you look.
I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.
"I listened for the echo and I heard only praise."
I'll be back.
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!
I'll have what she's having.
I'll miss this life and the people in it, but I've died before and I'll die again. That's just the way it goes.
I'll tell you, there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer. I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age.
I loathe people who keep dogs. They are cowards who haven't got the guts to bite people themselves.
I long for the slightest evidence of it that doesn't require me to relinquish reason, because a natural mystery and reason to face it make the happiest combination of all.
I look at all the colors around me, and I wonder, how many more are there that I don't know about.
I look at where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.
I look forward to making tangible and inspirational contributions to the Houston Technology Center's initiatives. HTC is an engine behind Houston's and Texas' continued growth.
I look up to a strong woman; maybe that's why I fell for Gaga. She works incredibly hard and is very strong and inspirational like Mom, with a great work ethic.
I love a lot of the New York bands, but Patti Smith stands out. I just read 'Just Kids' and it's an inspirational, well-written account of an emerging New York artist in the late seventies.
I love inspirational R&B, like Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson. I want to do that. That kind of music stays with you.
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
I love those who yearn for the impossible.
I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Life's a bitch. You've got to go out and kick ass.
I love what you did with the world.
I love what you did with your face. What do you call it?
I love what you did with your heart.
I love you as a guitar loves those playful nimble hands. Without your touch, the strings of my heart can't play the amazing songs of my life.
Il pessimismo radicale sconfina nell'ottimismo.
I'm a big believer in the power of inexperience. It was the greatest asset I had when I started TFA. If I had known at the outset how hard it was going to be, I might never have started.
I'm a bit of a P. T. Barnum. I make stars out of everyone.
I'm a computer nerd and I use data sheets on my bed. What do you use?
I made a resolve then that I was going to amount to something if I could. And no hours, nor amount of labor, nor amount of money would deter me from giving the best that there was in me. And I have done that ever since, and I win by it. I know.
I made art a philosophy, and philosophy an art: I altered the minds of men, and the colour of things: I awoke the imagination of my century so that it created myth and legend around me: I summed up all things in a phrase, all existence in an epigram: whatever I touched I made beautiful
I'm a designer, and I work very hard at that. People sometimes want to put down fashion by saying it's frivolous or superficial, but it's not that way at all. It's actually very hard work.
I'm a gay disabled man who has become very successful. I don't get up in the morning and think I'm inspirational; I just get up thinking that I love horses.
Imagination creates reality.
Imagination is cheap as long as you don't have to worry about the details.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
Imagination is not, as some poets have thought, simply synonymous with good. It may be either good or evil. As long as art remained primarily mimetic, the evil which imagination could do was limited by nature. Again, as long as it was treated as an amusement, the evil which it could do was limited in scope. But in an age when the connection between imagination and figuration is beginning to be dimly realized, when the fact of the directionally creator relation is beginning to break through into consciousness, both the good and the evil latent in the working of imagination begin to appear unlimited. We have seen in the Romantic movement an instance of the way in which the making of images may react upon the collective representations. It is a fairly rudimentary instance, but even so it has already gone beyond the dreams and responses of a leisured few. The economic and social structure of Switzerland is noticeably affected by its tourist industry, and that is due only in part to increased facilities of travel. It is due not less to the condition that (whatever may be said about their 'particles') the mountains which twentieth-century man sees are not the mountains which eighteenth-century man saw.
Imagine if every thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them in the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining!
Imagine others complexly.
Imagine that you were on the threshold of this fairytale, sometime billions of years ago when everything was created. And you were able to choose whether you wanted to be born to a life on this planet at some point. You wouldn't know when you were going to be born, nor how long you'd live for, but at any event it wouldn't be more than a few years. All you'd know was that, if you chose to come into the world at some point, you'd also have to leave it again one day and go away from everything. This might cause you a good deal of grief, as lots of people think that life in the great fairytale is so wonderful that the mere thought of it ending can bring tears to their eyes. Things can be so nice here that it's terribly painful to think that at some point the days will run out. What would you have chosen, if there had been some higher power that had gave you the choice? Perhaps we can imagine some sort of cosmic fairy in this great, strange fairytale. What you have chosen to live a life on earth at some point, whether short or long, in a hundred thousand or a hundred million years? Or would you have refused to join in the game because you didn't like the rules? (...) I asked myself the same question maybe times during the past few weeks. Would I have elected to live a life on earth in the firm knowledge that I'd suddenly be torn away from it, and perhaps in the middle of intoxicating happiness? (...) Well, I wasn't sure what I would have chosen. (...) If I'd chosen never to the foot inside the great fairytale, I'd never have known what I've lost. Do you see what I'm getting at? Sometimes it's worse for us human beings to lose something dear to us than never to have had it at all.
Imagine Your Life Is Perfect In Every Respect; What Would It Look Like?
I'm a greater believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.
I'm a hateful sadist. I make everyone's day nice so that I can sit back and watch what happens.
I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
I'm always asked, 'What's the secret to success?' But there are no secrets. Be humble. Be hungry. And always be the hardest worker in the room.
I'm always happy to trade performance for readability as long as the former isn't already scarce.
I'm a motivational speaker.
I'm an addict, I'm addicted to success. Thankfully, there's no rehab for success.
I man is a prisoner of only his own mind.
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
I may be compelled to face danger, but never fear it, and while our soldiers can stand and fight, I can stand and feed and nurse them.
I may not have a talent, but I am passionate.
I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.
I'm better than P. T. Barnum and Colonel Parker put together.
I'm different, and I have to be a warrior to be that way. But I have had some success; I hope I have touched the lives of some wonderful people, all by being what I see as myself but some others people see as different.
I mean, funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you?
I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for me.
I mean really, how could an artistic individual stay grounded in the nitty-gritty of how many minutes per pound meat has to stay in the oven when trying to fathom the creative philosophy behind the greatest artistic minds of the world?
I'm extremely ambitious. I don't know why people are afraid to say that. I won't sell my soul to the devil, but I do want success and I don't think that's bad.
I'm feeling argumentative. Please contradict me.
I'm going to be a color terrorist. No color will be safe as long as I am armed with a paintbrush or spray can.
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.
I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life.
I'm happy to be on a winning team. My individual success, that lasts for a short period of time. The success of being a part of the South, of Atlanta, which is now the hot bed of music, that's what's gonna last the longest. The fact that I contributed to planting our flag and moving music to my city, that's what I'm most proud of.
I'm having a deja vu experience, just like last time.
I'm having an old friend for dinner.
I'm here, and now, so are you.
I might have added, as it entered my mind to do, that some people found satisfaction in being. Being. Others in becoming. Being people have all the breaks. Becoming people are very unlucky, always in a tizzy. The Becoming people are always have to make explanations or offer justifications of the Being people. While the Being people provoke these explanations.
I'm intimidated by the fear of being average.
I mistrust all systematizers and I avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
I'm looking into my past lives. I'm convinced some of them still owe me money.
I'm lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.
I'm more than ever of the opinion that a decent human existence is possible today only on the fringes of society, where one then runs the risk of starving or being stoned to death. In these circumstances, a sense of humor is a great help.
I'm not a defender of old or new football managers. I believe in good ones and bad ones, those that achieve success and those that don't.
I'm not an inspirational quote kind of person.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love.
I'm not going to get somewhere and say, 'OK, I'm done.' Success is never final; I'll just keep on going. The same way as failure never being fatal. Just keep going. I'm going to the stars and then past them.
I'm not happy on vacation. In those rare times when I have three hours with no work I have to do, I'm terribly uncomfortable.
I'm not here to impose Sharia law, and I'm not here to have a message about disability being inspirational - I'm here to make people laugh. But when I can layer things and make people not only laugh but question, make people not only laugh but be offended... I have to do that.
I'm not really easy to live with! There needs to be unlimited patience and unconditional love. Men I've known before loved my independent spirit and were proud of my success, to the point that they'd become jealous of the time I devote to my career.
I'm not stupid. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.
I'm not superstitious. I'm a witch. Witches aren't superstitious. We are what people are superstitious of.
Impossibilities are merely things which we have not yet learned.
Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools.
Impossible things are really rough to do, you know.
Imprisoning philosophy within the professionalizations and specializations of an institutionalized curriculum, after the manner of our contemporary European and North American culture, is arguably a good deal more effective in neutralizing its effects than either religious censorship or political terror
I'm probably 20 percent atheist and 80 percent agnostic. I don't think anyone really knows. You'll either find out or not when you get there, until then there's no point thinking about it.
I'm still craving approval from my parents. It took a lot of success for me to realize it was never coming. It's just not in their nature.
I'm sure I've been damaged by philosophy.
I'm the king of the world!
I'm thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. I've always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too.
I'm tired of eating broccoli and expecting it to taste like ice-cream.
I'm used to adversity and working really well in difficult situations. It was hard for me to accept the success.
I must admit that I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings.
I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.
I'm very fond of the British cinema. I'm a big fan of Martin Campbell and Daniel Craig. I actually find Daniel very inspirational, especially on the physical side of things. He really inspired me to get back into shape when I started to add on a few pounds. I think he's a great role model.
I'm very polite by nature, even the voices in my head let each other finish their sentences.
I'm walking here! I'm walking here!
In 20 years, you probably won't even remember this.
In a balanced organization, working towards a common objective, there is success.
In actual fact. The manifold sexualities - those which appear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relationships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and student, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)- all form the correlate of exact procedures of power.
In actuality, California could be a wonderful place to live. In fact, if you're highly educated and ambitious, you can do quite well here while enjoying the sun and the fun. The only problem: California will then blame you for your success and recommend that all your cash be removed from you.
In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that account a great deal too much contempt of men.
In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.
In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure.
In an average day, you may well be confronted with some species of bullying or bigotry, or some ill-phrased appeal to the general will, or some petty abuse of authority. If you have a political loyalty, you may be offered a shady reason for agreeing to a lie or a half-truth that serves some short-term purpose. Everybody devises tactics for getting through such moments; try behaving "as if" they need not be tolerated and are not inevitable.
In an earlier stage of our development most human groups held to a tribal ethic. Members of the tribe were protected, but people of other tribes could be robbed or killed as one pleased. Gradually the circle of protection expanded, but as recently as 150 years ago we did not include blacks. So African human beings could be captured, shipped to America, and sold. In Australia white settlers regarded Aborigines as a pest and hunted them down, much as kangaroos are hunted down today. Just as we have progressed beyond the blatantly racist ethic of the era of slavery and colonialism, so we must now progress beyond the speciesist ethic of the era of factory farming, of the use of animals as mere research tools, of whaling, seal hunting, kangaroo slaughter, and the destruction of wilderness. We must take the final step in expanding the circle of ethics. -
In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In any compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit.
In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.
In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and the future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line. You will pardon some obscurities, for there are more secrets in my trade than in most men's, and yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable from its very nature.
In a traditional German toilet, the hole into which shit disappears after we flush is right at the front, so that shit is first laid out for us to sniff and inspect for traces of illness. In the typical French toilet, on the contrary, the hole is at the back, i.e. shit is supposed to disappear as quickly as possible. Finally, the American (Anglo-Saxon) toilet presents a synthesis, a mediation between these opposites: the toilet basin is full of water, so that the shit floats in it, visible, but not to be inspected. [...] It is clear that none of these versions can be accounted for in purely utilitarian terms: each involves a certain ideological perception of how the subject should relate to excrement. Hegel was among the first to see in the geographical triad of Germany, France and England an expression of three different existential attitudes: reflective thoroughness (German), revolutionary hastiness (French), utilitarian pragmatism (English). In political terms, this triad can be read as German conservatism, French revolutionary radicalism and English liberalism. [...] The point about toilets is that they enable us not only to discern this triad in the most intimate domain, but also to identify its underlying mechanism in the three different attitudes towards excremental excess: an ambiguous contemplative fascination; a wish to get rid of it as fast as possible; a pragmatic decision to treat it as ordinary and dispose of it in an appropriate way. It is easy for an academic at a round table to claim that we live in a post-ideological universe, but the moment he visits the lavatory after the heated discussion, he is again knee-deep in ideology.
In a world of chance is there a better and a worse? We yield to a stranger's embrace or give ourselves to the waves; for the blink of an eyelid our vigilance relaxes; we are asleep; and when we awake, we have lost the direction of our lives. What are these blinks of an eyelid, against which the only defence is an eternal and inhuman wakefulness? Might they not be the cracks and chinks through which another voice, other voices, speak in our lives? By what right do we close our ears to them? (Susan Barton)
In business, you can have one massive success that earns $50 million overnight, and that's it. You're successful. End of story. But in the music business, you have to keep on doing it.
Independence is happiness.
Indomitable perseverance in a business, properly understood, always ensures ultimate success.
Industry suffers from the managerial dogma that for the sake of stability and continuity, the company should be independent of the competence of individual employees. Hence industry rejects any methodological proposal that can be viewed as making intellectual demands on its work force. Since in the US the influence of industry is more pervasive than elsewhere, the above dogma hurts American computing science most. The moral of this sad part of the story is that as long as computing science is not allowed to save the computer industry, we had better see to it that the computer industry does not kill computing science.
In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, an ass and a nightingale. Diversity of character is due to their unequal activity.
I need just be a bayonet, a bayonet named Diving Punishment. I wish I'd been born a storm. Or a menace. Or a single grenade. No heart, no tears, just as a terrible gale'd have been good. If [by doing this] I become that, then so be it.
In essence I find that the foundation of modern conservatism is driven by a clinging to God in fear of the world, whereas the foundation of modern liberalism is a clinging to the world in fear of God; albeit, the true foundation should be one's clinging to God in fear of God.
I never assumed I would have that commercial success, so it was a total surprise. And honestly, I never assumed that it would ever happen again.
I never could have achieved the success that I have without setting physical activity and health goals.
I never could read Foucault. I find philosophy tedious. All of my knowledge comes from reading novels and some history. I read Being and Nothingness and realized that I remembered absolutely nothing when I finished it. I used to go to the library every day and read every day for eight hours. I'd dropped out of high school and had to teach myself. I read Sartre without any background. I just forced myself and I learned nothing.
I never dreamt of success. I worked for it.
I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird'... I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement.
I never found beauty in longing for the impossible and never found the possible to be beyond my reach.
I never knew a man come to greatness or eminence who lay abed late in the morning.
I never quite understood the question that says, is the glass half empty or half full? What's the difference? Eventually it'll end up empty and in the trash.
I never took a day off in my 20s. Not one.
I never wake up today with yesterday's problems.
In every ancient religious and sacred text, faith is a verb; a thing to be demonstrated. It is in modern days that we have diluted faith from an act to a philosophy.
Inevitably it follows that anyone with an independent mind must become 'one who resists or opposes an authority or established convention': a
In fact, I wouldn't really call this a Gospel album, I call it more an inspirational album.
Infinitely more important than sharing one's material wealth is sharing the wealth of ourselves, our time and energy, our passion and commitment, and, above all, our love.
In football everything is complicated by the presence of the opposite team.
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.
In general, I try and distinguish between what one calls the Future and "l'avenir" [the 'to come]. The future is that which -- tomorrow, later, next century -- will be. There is a future which is predictable, programmed, scheduled, foreseeable. But there is a future, l'avenir (to come) which refers to someone who comes whose arrival is totally unexpected. For me, that is the real future. That which is totally unpredictable. The Other who comes without my being able to anticipate their arrival. So if there is a real future, beyond the other known future, it is l'avenir in that it is the coming of the Other when I am completely unable to foresee their arrival.
In God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?
In great matters men show themselves as they wish to be seen; in small matters, as they are.
In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give out completes the circle and comes back to us.
In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success.
In inner-city, low-income communities of color, there's such a high correlation in terms of educational quality and success.
In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.
In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.
In life sometimes your neighbour drowns in the rains you prayed for"
In mathematics or physics, infinity is greater than one or two or any number countable. In how many ways can the world be destroyed based on ordered knowledge? You may be able to count this. But the truth is, you "really" don't know. These possibilities in your mind hold a set of unpredictable orders. One effect may be causative of another of another. It could be a culmination of effects you know as events where events are sets and subsets of potential possibilities.
In meetings philosophy might work,
In most things success depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed.
In motivating people, you've got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved.
In my experience, there is only one motivation, and that is desire. No reasons or principle contain it or stand against it.
In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted.
In my haste to die, I really found out that I wanted to live.
In my heart's most secret place,
In my opinion, our health care system has failed when a doctor fails to treat an illness that is treatable.
In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity.
Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
In numele si sub teroarea ei (plictiselii, n.m.) parasesc oamenii caminul si moartea agreabila legata de el si se avanta in lume, spre a muri undeva fara acoperis si fara lacrimi; adolescentii se gandesc la sinucideri in zile infinite de primavara, iar servitoarele fara amanti se lamenteaza duminicile, de parca inima lor e un cimitir in care mortii nu pot dormi.
In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself.
In one way, I suppose, I have been "in denial" for some time, knowingly burning the candle at both ends and finding that it often gives a lovely light. But for precisely that reason, I can't see myself smiting my brow with shock or hear myself whining about how it's all so unfair: I have been taunting the Reaper into taking a free scythe in my direction and have now succumbed to something so predictable and banal that it bores even me.
In order that people may be happy in their work, these three things are needed: They must be fit for it. They must not do too much of it. And they must have a sense of success in it.
In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd.
In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different.
In order to discover new lands, one must be willing to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.
In order to succeed you must fail so that you know what not to do the next time.
In order to succeed you must fail, so that you know what not to do the next time.
In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.
In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume that it is true and try to find out what it could be true of.
In our country religion is not different from philosophy and religion
In our own wild nature we find the best recreation from our un-nature, from our spirituality.
In particular those who are condemned to stagnation are often pronounced happy on the pretext that happiness consists in being at rest. This notion we reject, for our perspective is that of existentialist ethics. Every subject plays his part as such specifically through exploits or projects that serve as a mode of transcendence; he achieves liberty only through a continual reaching out towards other liberties. There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future. Every time transcendence falls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of existence into the 'en-sois' -- the brutish life of subjection to given conditions -- and of liberty into constraint and contingence. This downfall represents a moral fault if the subject consents to it; if it is inflicted upon him, it spells frustration and oppression. In both cases it is an absolute evil. Every individual concerned to justify his existence feels that his existence involves an undefined need to transcend himself, to engage in freely chosen projects.
In philosophy class I think we finally decided that 'good' is an infinitely recursive term - it can't be defined except in terms of itself. Good is good because it's better than bad, though why it's better to be good than bad depends on how you define good, and on and on.
In philosophy it is always good to put a question instead of an answer to a question. For an answer to the philosophical question may easily be unfair; disposing of it by means of another question is not.
In politics, the pen is at its heaviest because it is weighed down by the collective responsibility it holds towards its people and their future in the eyes of the world.
In politics we presume that everyone who knows how to get votes knows how to administer a city or a state. When we are ill... we do not ask for the handsomest physician, or the most eloquent one.
In practice people who study philosophy too long become very odd birds, not to say thoroughly vicious; while even those who are the best of them are reduced by...[philosophy] to complete uselessness as members of society.
In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.
In presence of the Moon nobody sees stars.
In reality there are no separate events. Life moves along like water, it's all connected to the source of the river is connected to the mouth and the ocean.
In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute.
In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.
Insanity in individuals is something rare--but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.
In seeking happiness for others, you find it for yourself.
In short, philosophical theories are largely the product of the hidden hand of the cognitive unconscious.
Inside, I've got a real purist desire and dream about the music. I like the idea of being able to carve out a kind of magical, colourful, artistic, inspirational life. And the reality just turns out to be quite different, working with the business to bring this thing you have created into the world.
In silence, I can hear your voice. In your absence, I can see your magnificence.
In silence man can most readily preserve his integrity.
In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.
In so far as the culture industry arouses a feeling of well-being that the world is precisely in that order suggested by the culture industry, the substitute gratification which it prepares for human beings cheats them out of the same happiness which it deceitfully projects.
In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering among innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge.
In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of "world history"- yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die.
Inspirational leaders need to have a winning mentality in order to inspire respect. It is hard to trust in the leadership of someone who is half-hearted about their purpose, or only sporadic in focus or enthusiasm.
Inspiration does exist but it must find you working.
Inspiration may be a form of super-consciousness, or
In sports teams, apart from talk of sporting prowess and the imparting of inspirational thought, an extraordinary amount of time is spent discussing, and flaunting, material possessions.
Instead of complaining that the rose bush is full of thorns, be happy the thorn bush has roses.
Instead of this confusion, we need the unifying force of an official language, English, which is the language of success in America.
Instinct is a makeshift, an admission of helplessness before the problem of reality.
Integrity is doing what is right. Ethics is doing what is right for a society. The philosophy of ethics is very interesting and unsettling. Ethics often depends on societal beliefs, religious beliefs, personal beliefs, personal emotions, and the laws of a country. Honor killings are ethical in some societies even though they are considered evil acts for a civilized society. We should promote what is right for your conscience and for universal human rights. We can create a universal ethical stand point.
Integrity is so perishable in the summer months of success.
Integrity is telling myself the truth. And honesty is telling the truth to other people.
Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.
Intelligence is more important than strength, that is why earth is ruled by men and not by animals.
In terms of energy, it's better to make a wrong choice than none at all.
In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves have still their impersonal scorn--for "woman".
In the battle that is philosophy all the techniques of war, including looting and camouflage, are permissible.
In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few
In the deep-freezing winter, let us sing heart touching songs of love to invite the blooming spring and amazing summer. Wishing you a warm-loving winter morning!
In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: Did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, "The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language." What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!
In the end, it is our defiance that redeems us. If wolves had a religion -- if there was a religion of the wolf -- that it is what it would tell us.
In the end mortals always expired before faeries. They were such finite creatures. Their first heartbeat and breath were but a blink from death. To add the weight of nourishing his insatiable court in a time of peace was to hasten that unconscionably.
In the end, you make your reputation and you have your success based upon credibility and being able to provide people who are really hungry for information what they want.
In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it--or worse still! under their dress and finery.
In the first six to twelve months of a war with the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no expectation of success.
In the good old days physicists repeated each other's experiments, just to be sure. Today they stick to FORTRAN, so that they can share each other's programs, bugs included.
In the high country of the mind one has to become adjusted to the thinner air of uncertainty...
In the hour of adversity, be not without hope; for crystal rain falls from black clouds.
In the Kamigata area, they have a sort of tiered lunchbox they use for a single day when flower viewing. Upon returning, they throw them away, trampling them underfoot. The end is important in all things.
In the letter he left for the coroner he had explained his reasoning (for suicide): that life is a gift bestowed without anyone asking for it; that the thinking person has a philosophical duty to examine both the nature of life and the conditions it comes with; and that if this person decides to renounce the gift no one asks for, it is the moral and human duty to act on the consequences of that decision. ... Alex showed me a clipping from the
In the liquid amber within the ivory porcelain, the initiated may touch the sweet reticence of Confucius, the piquancy of Laotse, and the ethereal aroma of Sakyamuni himself.
In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.
In the most general terms, the Enlightenment goes back to Plato's belief that truth and beauty and goodness are connected; that truth and beauty, disseminated widely, will sooner or later lead to goodness. (While we're making at effort at truth and goodness, beauty reminds us what we're hold out for.)
In the name of Bacon will you chicken me up that egg.
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.
In the practice of tolerance, one's enemy is the best teacher.
In the pragmatist, streetwise climate of advanced postmodern capitalism, with its scepticism of big pictures and grand narratives, its hard-nosed disenchantment with the metaphysical, 'life' is one among a whole series of discredited totalities. We are invited to think small rather than big -- ironically, at just the point when some of those out to destroy Western civilization are doing exactly the opposite. In the conflict between Western capitalism and radical Islam, a paucity of belief squares up to an excess of it. The West finds itself faced with a full-blooded metaphysical onslaught at just the historical point that it has, so to speak, philosophically disarmed. As far as belief goes, postmodernism prefers to travel light: it has beliefs, to be sure, but it does not have faith.
In the process of burning out these confusions, we discover enlightenment. If the process were otherwise, the awakened state of mind would be a product dependent upon cause and effect and therefore liable to dissolution. Anything which is created must, sooner or later, die. If enlightenment were created in such a way, there would always be a possibility of ego reasserting itself, causing a return to the confused state. Enlightenment is permanent because we have not produced it; we have merely discovered it.
In the progress of politics, as in the common occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but frequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may so say, the knowledge of every day on the circumstances that produce it, and journey on in search of new matter and new refinements: but as it is pleasant and sometimes useful to look back, even to the first periods of infancy, and trace the turns and windings through which we have passed, so we may likewise derive many advantages by halting a while in our political career, and taking a review of the wondrous complicated labyrinth of little more than yesterday.
In the summer, we write life's summary with the slow waves of love flowing over the sandy beach. The slow breeze and the warm sun write our memories.
In the United States, I am a great success, but I am not a celebrity.
In the United States there's a Puritan ethic and a mythology of success. He who is successful is good. In Latin countries, in Catholic countries, a successful person is a sinner.
In the world of art, all things are possible.--George from Paradise Kiss
In this age, the mere example of non-conformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom, is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigor, and moral courage which it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.
in this case, a mother, noted for her beauty, might be reduced to a purple shadow... (Tansley to Lily on her painting of the house
In this world it is not what we take up, but what we give up, that makes us rich.
In truth, Freud sees nothing and understands nothing.
In union there is strength.
Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack.
In weariness, existence is like the reminder of a commitment to exist, with all the seriousness and harshness of an irrevocable contract. One has to do something, one has to aspire after and undertake [...] In weariness we want to escape existence itself, and not only one of its landscapes in a longing for more beautiful skies. An evasion without an itinerary and without an end, it is not trying to come ashore somewhere.
I once had a mouse model, but she turned out to be a real rat!
I once tried pyramid selling, but after I started to advertise the Egyptian government closed me down.
I only know that I know nothing
I only seem negative to the fortunate. That's because I show the less fortunate that they aren't less fortunate after all.
I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by losing.
I pray daily that more of my fellow programmers may find the means of freeing themselves from the curse of compatibility.
I pray God may preserve your health and life many years.
I prefer for 'my world' to have the highest certification of being a faithful representation of the exterior world.
I pretend not to be a champion of that same naked virtue called truth, to the very outrance. I can consent that her charms be hidden with a veil, were it but for decency's sake.
I pull a lot of the stuff that I play off the rhythm tracks - and Keith Richards has been one of the main contributors to my inspirational playing.
I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.
I realized I love motivating and I love empowering and I love inspiring people. I did that as an athlete for 18 years, and I am able to do that as a motivational speaker now as well as doing work on television.
I realized that conservatism was the philosophy that best suited me, with its emphasis on individual liberty, personal responsibility, and merit.
I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life.
I really think that it's disgusting that Paris is the only place where it is illegal for paps to follow you around. It actually took someone losing their life - Diana, an inspirational woman - and then it changed, but they still won't change it in London! It's horrible!
I refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.
I refuse to let the standards of evil people chip away at my capacity for integrity.
I remember growing up, saying you're an artist it sounds pretentious but now it's one of the only dignified things that you can call yourself.
I remember one day sitting at the pool and suddenly the tears were streaming down my cheeks. Why was I so unhappy? I had success. I had security. But it wasn't enough. I was exploding inside.
I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.
Irrational expectations are at the root of most human suffering.
Irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion. Not to speak of its importance in philosophy. Irreverence is the only way left to us for testing our universe.
I said to the almond tree, 'Friend, speak to me of God,' and the almond tree blossomed.
I saw a lot of people have success handed to them that then exploited it. They didn't protect it or cherish it.
I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing that you are the beholder.
Is beauty enhanced or adulterated by utility?
I scream in silence because my voice has lost the power to be heard!
I see dead people.
I see things in windows and I say to myself that I want them. I want them because I want to belong. I want to be liked by more people, I want to be held in higher regard than others. I want to feel valued, so I say to myself to watch certain shows. I watch certain shows on the television so I can participate in dialogues and conversations and debates with people who want the same things I want. I want to dress a certain way so certain groups of people are forced to be attracted to me. I want to do my hair a certain way with certain styling products and particular combs and methods so that I can fit in with the In-Crowd. I want to spend hours upon hours at the gym, stuffing my body with what scientists are calling 'superfoods', so that I can be loved and envied by everyone around me. I want to become an icon on someone's mantle. I want to work meaningless jobs so that I can fill my wallet and parentally-advised bank accounts with monetary potential. I want to believe what's on the news so that I can feel normal along with the rest of forever. I want to listen to the Top Ten on Q102, and roll my windows down so others can hear it and see that I am listening to it, and enjoying it. I want to go to church every Sunday, and pray every other day. I want to believe that what I do is for the promise of a peaceful afterlife. I want rewards for my 'good' deeds. I want acknowledgment and praise. And I want people to know that I put out that fire. I want people to know that I support the war effort. I want people to know that I volunteer to save lives. I want to be seen and heard and pointed at with love. I want to read my name in the history books during a future full of clones exactly like me.
I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings.
I shiver, thinking how easy it is to be totally wrong about people-to see one tiny part of them and confuse it for the whole, to see the cause and think it's the effect or vice versa
I should attempt to treat human vice and folly geometrically... the passions of hatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, follow from the necessity and efficacy of nature... I shall, therefore, treat the nature and strength of the emotion in exactly the same manner, as though I were concerned with lines, planes, and solids.
I should go so far as to say that embedded in the surrealistic frame of a television news show is a theory of anticommunication, featuring a type of discourse that abandons logic, reason, sequence and rules of contradiction. In aesthetics, I believe the name given to this theory is Dadaism; in philosophy, nihilism; in psychiatry, schizophrenia. In the parlance of the theater, it is known as vaudeville.
Is it better to be loved or feared?
Is it better to go with the flow or let the flow go?
Is it better to work out consciously and critically one's own conception of the world and thus, in connection with the labours of one's own brain, choose one's sphere of activity, take an active part in the creation of the history of the world, be one's own guide, refusing to accept passively and supinely from outside the moulding of one' own personality?
Is it possible for a man to move the earth? Yes; but he must first find out another earth to stand upon.
Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?
... is it truly possible to steal a life, if... the Self is eternal and cannot die? Should this be so, then one who 'murders' does no more than transgress against the will of another, whose choice it is to live. At bottom, a murderer offends not against the body, but against the spirit.
Islam deals not only with what man must and must not do, but also with what he needs to know. In other words, Islam is both a way of acting and doing things and a way of knowing.
Isn't the zipper on your pants supposed to be in the front?
Isn't wine prohibited here?" the boy asked. "It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil," said the alchemist. "It's what comes out of their mouths that is.
I sort of understood that when I first started: that you shouldn't repeat a success. Very often you're going to, and maybe the first time you do, it works. And you love it. But then you're trapped.
I speak gibberish to the civilized world and it replies in kind.
Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.
I started doing motivational tours. I've seen all kinds of people, from the CEOs to the lowest executive, opening up to their fears. We don't introspect as much as we should.
I started my life with a single absolute: that the world was mine to shape in the image of my highest values and never to be given up to a lesser standard, no matter how long or hard the struggle.
I started studying law, but this I could stand just for one semester. I couldn't stand more. Then I studied languages and literature for two years. After two years I passed an examination with the result I have a teaching certificate for Latin and Hungarian for the lower classes of the gymnasium, for kids from 10 to 14. I never made use of this teaching certificate. And then I came to philosophy, physics, and mathematics. In fact, I came to mathematics indirectly. I was really more interested in physics and philosophy and thought about those. It is a little shortened but not quite wrong to say: I thought I am not good enough for physics and I am too good for philosophy. Mathematics is in between.
Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?
I stopped believing in Santa Claus at age six when my mother took me to see him in a store and he asked for my autograph.
I strive for perfection - I settle for satisfaction
I suppose therefore that all things I see are illusions; I believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me. I think I have no senses. I believe that body, shape, extension, motion, location are functions. What is there then that can be taken as true? Perhaps only this one thing, that nothing at all is certain.
I suppose your security is your success and your key to success is your fine palate.
I surround myself with things that make me happy. Why? Because ... it makes me happy.
I survived because the fire inside me burned brighter than the fire around me.
It ain't about how hard you can hit. Its about how hard you can get hit, and how much you can take, and keep moving forward.
It ain't no broken.
I take great pride in all the tremendous success we've enjoyed at CBS. And the good news is that I feel even more enthusiastic about what my terrific team and I will accomplish going forward.
I Take Life Very Seriously: One Joke At A Time.
I take no pride in hopeless longing; I wouldn't hold a stillborn aspiration. I'd want to have it, to make it, to live it.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
It always seems impossible until its done.
It always takes two. For relationships to work, for them to break apart, for them to be fixed.
It comes as no surprise to find [Norman] Mailer embracing [in the book
It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many errors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we should therefore leave off being religious at all. By being religious we establish ourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our private destiny, after all.
It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
It doesn't matter how far you might rise. At some point, you are bound to stumble.... If you're constantly pushing yourself higher...the law of averages, not to mention the Myth of Icarus, predicts that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to know this, remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.
It doesn't matter how smart you are unless you stop and think.
It doesn't matter how you get there if you don't know where you're going.
It doesn't matter if you try and try and try again, and fail. It does matter if you try and fail, and fail to try again.
It doesn't matter whether you are pursuing success in business, sports, the arts, or life in general: The bridge between wishing and accomplishing is discipline.
It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.
It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil - which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.
I tell you as well as myself: what we see with our own eyes is nothing other than a cloud concealing what we should perceive with our inner sight, while what we listen to with our ears is merely a ringing sound disturbing what we should understand with our hearts. When we see a man being taken to prion by a police officer let us not hasten to assume he is a wrong-doer. When we see a corpse, and a man standing beside it with bloodstained hands, let us not conclude that this is a victim and his assassin. When we hear one man singing and another lamenting, let us ascertain which one of the two is truly happy.
I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: you have still chaos in you.
It goes without saying that these effects do not suffice to annul the necessity for a "change of terrain." It also goes without saying that the choice between these two forms of deconstruction cannot be simple and unique. A new writing must weave and interlace these two motifs of deconstruction. Which amounts to saying that one must speak several languages and produce several texts at once. I would like to point out especially that the style of the first deconstruction is mostly that of the Heideggerian questions, and the other is mostly the one which dominates France today. I am purposely speaking in terms of a dominant style: because there are also breaks and changes of terrain in texts of the Heideggerian type; because the "change of terrain" is far from upsetting the entire French landscape to which I am referring; because what we need, perhaps, as Nietzsche said, is a change of "style"; and if there is style, Nietzsche reminded us, it must be plural.
It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.
I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes.
I think, aesthetically, car design is so interesting - the dashboards, the steering wheels, and the beauty of the mechanics. I don't know how any of it works, I don't want to know, but it's inspirational.
I think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88% chance of mission success and maybe 96% chance of survival. And we were willing to take those odds.
I think and think for months and years, ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.
I think anyone who has a passion for what they love to do, and who pursue it, is inspirational for me.
I think baking is very rewarding, and if you follow a good recipe, you will get success.
I think being directed and mentored by someone as inspirational as Paul Feig not only improves my performance but, as a whole, makes it what it is.
I think 'Heroes of Cosplay' will show a lot of the positive things, like how much effort it takes to make a costume. These people on the show aren't taking shortcuts. As long as that effort gets through to the viewers, we will be inspirational. Then there will be people who watch the show that want to get in and hands-on make outfits.
I think I am, therefore, I am... I think.
I think I exist, therefore I exist. I think.
I think if there's something one needs to change with oneself, it doesn't have to happen in the New Year. You can do that any time you please - not that it's not a good inspirational tactic for the people that it works for.
I think in terms of evolutions, not revolutions. Failure is not part of my vocabulary.
I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.
I think it's real easy to be famous these days; it's not real easy to sustain success.
I think it's way harder when you have success, 'cause people tend to not treat you the same or look at you the same because they see the success or the money you make.
I think it was the institution...I was trying to master it.
I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom.
I think of doing a series as very hard work. But then I've talked to coal miners, and that's really hard work.
I think people who are creative are the luckiest people on earth. I know that there are no shortcuts, but you must keep your faith in something Greater than You, and keep doing what you love. Do what you love, and you will find the way to get it out to the world.
I think Spain will always remain inspirational, and I think French cuisine will continue to be very French and yet very relevant with its time and keep evolving. But the last thing you want for it is to become too trendy and confusing. It has too much history.
I think that all right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that ordinary, decent people are fed up in this country with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not! But I'm sick and tired of being told that I am!
I think that my biggest attribute to any success that I have had is hard work. There really is no substitute for working hard.
I think that's a great opportunity, to pick a script where you can build up a good skill. I think the main thing I look for when I look at scripts is if it's inspirational. If it's something that teenagers can relate to. And is it something that the audience is going to get something out of. If not, then it's really not worth doing.
I think that success is having fun.
I think that the reason for my success is that I am really not aspirational. I am inspirational in that the people at home feel like they can really relate to me.
I think that the task of philosophy is not to provide answers, but to show how the way we perceive a problem can be itself part of a problem.
I think that when we have a better educated society, when there is less violence in our cities, when people get back into the workforce and have the opportunity to take care of themselves and their families - that for me really is the kind of success and the kind of America that I think most of us still want, we aspire to.
I think the biggest challenge is to continue on the same path. I think it's easy to become complacent from the success you've had.
I think the end goal, hopefully, is to take advantage of the attention I've gotten along the way and use it for good and build some communities, and as I get older I can continue to do things and be surrounded by things that are inspirational to me.
I think the internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that's missing but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash.
I think, therefore a single fertilized egg cell can replicate itself into trillions of specialized and exquisitely organized cells.
I think, therefore I'll think.
I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.
I think there's an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face - that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old-time religion which, in my view, is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society.
I think there's a world market for about 5 computers.
I think the root of your mistake is saying that macros don't scale to larger groups. The real truth is that macros don't scale to stupider groups.
I think the success that I have is due to hard work and destiny. It is important to stay grounded and not take things for granted.
I think the thing about that was I was always willing to work; I was not the fastest or biggest player but I was determined to be the best football player I could be on the football field and I think I was able to accomplish that through hard work.
I think the thing to do is enjoy the ride while you're on it.
I think to think. Not to be thought-full, or to reach a point of wisdom or acquire a grace of knowledge. I think for the sensuality of thought.
I think true success is intrinsic... It's love. It's kindness. It's community.
I think us here to wonder, myself. To wonder. To ask. And that in wondering bout the big things and asking bout the big things, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. But you never know nothing more about the big things than you start out with. The more I wonder, the more I love.
I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure, but no good explanation for success.
I think you can have moderate success by copying something else, but if you really want to knock it out of the park, you have to do something different and take chances.
I thought 'Moulin Rouge' was inspirational, and 'Jesus Christ Superstar' I loved.
It is a bitter thought, how different a thing the Christianity of the world might have been, if the Christian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under the auspices of Marcus Aurelius instead of those of Constantine.
It is a blessed thing that in every age someone has had the individuality enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions.
It is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn author--and that he did not learn it better.

It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.
It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.
It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.

It is an ironic habit of human beings to run faster when they have lost their way.
It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.
It is a self-deception of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence.
It is a very delicate job to forgive a man, without lowering him in his own estimation, and yours too.
It is a well known fact that even among highly cultured peoples the belief in animism prevails generally. Even the scholar may kick the chair against which he accidentally stumbles, and derive great satisfaction from thus 'getting even' with the perverse chair.

It is by acts and not by ideas that people live.
It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.
It is closer to the truth to say that God is crazy than that God is reasonable. I suspect God merely smiles when someone calls him crazy, but shakes His head and frowns when someone calls Him reasonable.
It is culture that is the bully."
It is curious that the human mind could blindly accept an infinite speed but had reservations to accept a finite one, simply because it was too large!

It is easy to be conspicuously 'compassionate' if others are being forced to pay the cost.
It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they (world religions) disagree, not more than one of them can be true.

It is good to dream big but your dreams will never see the light of day if you sleep big too.
It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!
It is hard to be angry when one has seen the sun rise,' she said.
It is immoral to hold an opinion in order to curry another's favor; mercenary, servile, and against the dignity of human liberty to yield and submit; supremely stupid to believe as a matter of habit; irrational to decide according to the majority opinion, as if the number of sages exceeded the infinite number of fools.
It is impossible for Stream to achieve unhappiness. Indeed it is. Unless that is, it exists in consciousness. It is impossible for the unordered to achieve happiness or unhappiness unless it were to Flow a certain way in relation with ordered effects.Unhappiness, happiness is a potential activated by the ordered in Flow.
It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenious.
It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.
It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear its imperfections, if they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed unconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all the good which those imperfections qualify.
It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.
It is in the shelter of each other that the people live.
It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.

It is more Important to be of pure intention than of perfect action.
It is more shameful to distrust one's friends than to be deceived by them.
It is much wiser to take advice than to give it.
It is never ridicule, but a compliment, that knocks a philosopher off his feet. He is already positioned for every possible counter-attack, counter-argument, and retort...only to find a big bear hug coming his way.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
It is never too late to give up our prejudices.
It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.
It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.
It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.
It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your permission to possess it;--eh, my friends?

It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved... [A]ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical.
It isn't hard to be good from time to time. What is tough is being good every day.
It isn't pollution that's harming the environment, it's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it
It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.
It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.
It is of course no secret to contemporary philosophers and psychologists that man himself is changing in our violent century, under the influence, of course, not only of war and revolution, but also of practically everything else that lays claim to being "modern" and "progressive." We have already cited the most striking forms of Nihilist Vitalism, whose cumulative effect has been to uproot, disintegrate, and "mobilize" the individual, to substitute for his normal stability and rootedness a senseless quest for power and movement, and to replace normal human feeling by a nervous excitability. The work of Nihilist Realism, in practice as in theory, has been parallel and complementary to that of Vitalism: a work of standardization, specialization, simplification, mechanization, dehumanization; its effect has been to "reduce" the individual to the most "Primitive" and basic level, to make him in fact the slave of his environment, the perfect workman in Lenin's worldwide "factory.
It is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.
It is okay to be rich, but it is great to be a person of value.
It is only by being ordinary you get to be extraordinary. Being ordinary does not mean being a robotic slave to the social conformities, like everybody else, rather it means not giving importance to both the superficiality, that is the material, and the so-called spiritual.
It is only in sorrow bad weather masters us; in joy we face the storm and defy it.
It is our attitude toward events, not events themselves, which we can control. Nothing is by its own nature calamitous -- even death is terrible only if we fear it.
[...] It is. Philosophy is a field that, unfortunately, reminds me of that old Woody Allen joke, "those that can't do, teach, and those that can't teach, teach gym." And the worst part of philosophy is the philosophy of science; the only people, as far as I can tell, that read work by philosophers of science are other philosophers of science. It has no impact on physics what so ever, and I doubt that other philosophers read it because it's fairly technical. And so it's really hard to understand what justifies it. And so I'd say that this tension occurs because people in philosophy feel threatened, and they have every right to feel threatened, because science progresses and philosophy doesn't.
It is pointless to ask: Why then is sex so secret? What is this force that so long reduced it to silence and has only recently relaxed its hold somewhat, allowing us to question it perhaps, but always in the context of and through its repression? In reality, this question, so often repeated nowadays, is but the recent form of a considerable affirmation and a secular prescription: there is where the truth is; go see if you can uncover it. [...] It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all: What is this injunction? Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the truth in sex?
It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion.
It is possible that these millions of suns, along with thousands of millions more we cannot see, make up altogether but a globule of blood or lymph in the veins of an animal, of a minute insect, hatched in a world of whose vastness we can frame no conception, but which nevertheless would itself, in proportion to some other world, be no more than a speck of dust.
It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.
It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
It is reasonable to love the Absolute absolutely for the same reason it is reasonable to love the relative relatively.
It is related that Sakyamuni [the historical Buddha] once dismissed as of small consequence a feat of levitation on the part of a disciple, and cried out in pity for a yogin by the river who had spent twenty years of his human existence learning to walk on water, when the ferryman might have taken him across for a small coin.
It is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it.
It is said that the real winner is the one who lives in today but able to see tomorrow.
It is so inspirational, to see that in the world of Westeros, men are answering to women, and they are a force to be reckoned with. It's empowering, and it's inspirational as well, because you're just like, 'This is great!'
It is strange the way trauma deadens curiosity. To suffer cruelty in excess is to be delivered from care. The human heart sets aside its questions when the future is too capricious. This is the irony of tribulation.
It is such a luxury to open a new book that's highly recommended by friends - either an inspirational yet humorously self-deprecating memoir, or a page-turning piece of fiction.
It is suicide to be abroad. But what it is to be at home, ... what it is to be at home? A lingering dissolution.

It is the combination of reasonable talent and the ability to keep going in the face of defeat that leads to success.
It is the dull man who is always sure, and the sure man who is always dull.
It is the hopeful, buoyant, cheerful attitude of mind that wins. Optimism is a success builder; pessimism an achievement killer.
It is the man of science, eager to have his every opinion regenerated, his every idea rationalized, by drinking at the fountain of fact, and devoting all the energies of his life to the cult of truth, not as he understands it, but as he does not yet understand it, that ought properly to be called a philosopher.
It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
It is the nature of emergencies to be inconvenient.
It is the nature of the strong heart, that like the palm tree it strives ever upwards when it is most burdened.
It is the philosophers, theologians, and evangelists who are said to be filled with pride and bigotry due to the strong convictions that they represent. On the contrary, teachings can be either taken or dismissed; whereas voting is the only thing the average person can do to force everyone to live how they would prefer. A simple vote is among the largest yet most acceptable forms of bigotry, and that is because people play the card only when they feel that in doing so it conveniences themselves.
It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.
It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little.
It is therefore senseless to think of complaining since nothing foreign has decided what we feel, what we live, or what we are.
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
It is thus tolerance that is the source of peace, and intolerance that is the source of disorder and squabbling.
It is too difficult to think nobly when one thinks only of earning a living.
It is true that the aristocracies seem to have abused their monopoly of legal knowledge; and at all events their exclusive possession of the law was a formidable impediment to the success of those popular movements which began to be universal in the western world.
It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to restore honor..
It is very important to know who you are. To make decisions. To show who you are.
It is when those who are not strong enough have made some moderate amount of progress that they fail and give up...
It(mastering)'s knowing what you are doing.
It may be important to great thinkers to examine the world, to explain and despise it. But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for us to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect.
It must not be forgotten that reason too needs to be sustained in all its searching by trusting dialogue and sincere friendship. A climate of suspicion and distrust, which can beset speculative research, ignores the teaching of the ancient philosophers who proposed friendship as one of the most appropriate contexts for sound philosophical enquiry.
It never occurs to most of us .. that the question 'what
It never occurs to most of us .. that the question 'what is the truth' is no real question (being irrelative to all conditions) and that the whole notion of the truth is an abstraction from the fact of truths in the plural, a mere useful summarizing phrase like the Latin language or the Law.
It often occurs that pride and selfishness are muddled with strength and independence. They are neither equal nor similar; in fact, they are polar opposites. A coward may be so cowardly that he masks his weakness with some false personification of power. He is afraid to love and to be loved because love tends to strip bare all emotional barricades. Without love, strength and independence are prone to losing every bit of their worth; they become nothing more than a fearful, intimidated, empty tent lost somewhere in the desert of self.
I transform my enemy to a friend with my pen.
It really is an honor if I can be inspirational to a younger singer or person. It means I've done my job.
I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times, I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success; at others, I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience.
I tried to think the same thought in as many different religions as possible, so the thought itself wouldn't be limited by any particular way of reasoning, the way words restrict -- the whole eskimo-seventeen-words-for-snow idea.
I try not to put anything political on the forefront of what I'm trying to do creatively. At the same time, I do think it's wonderful when I hear people say that it's inspirational that I'm an Indian woman on camera. My life is very diverse, and my friends are a diverse group of people.
I try--without success--to stop finding reasons for vanity in anything. When I happen to manage it nonetheless, I feel that I no longer belong to the mortal gang. I am above everything then, above the gods themselves. Perhaps that is what death is: a sensation of great, of extreme superiority.
It's alive! It's alive!
It's always seemed a little preposterous that Hamlet, for all his paralyzing doubt about everything, never once doubts the reality of the ghost. Never questions his own madness might not in fact be unfeigned.
It's always too early to quit.
It's a moment that I'm after, a fleeting moment, but not a frozen moment.
It's an already inside outside,
It's a philosophical minefield!"
It's a sad day for American Capitalism when a man can't fly a midget on a kite over central park.
It's as if inside the White House the belief in Obama's inspirational charisma is still such that every time the ugliness of brute politics intrudes, it's a startling revelation.
It's a slow process, but quitting won't speed it up.
It's a small world, but I'd hate to have to paint it.
It's a small world, but I wouldn't like to paint it.
It's a special person - and personality - who can lead a start-up to soaring success and sustain that success for the long term. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are star examples.

It's at night when my dreams come alive.
It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.
It's because of you that I know that God exists.
It's better to be boldly decisive and risk being wrong than to agonize at length and be right too late.
It's better to have a million small religions with each one containing a great truth. Than one great religion containing a million small truths.
It's better to have nobody than someone who is half there, or who doesn't want to be there.
It's both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success.
It's cool to have critical success because it's always nice for your peers to say, 'Good job.' But who cares about them?
It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.
It's easy to hate and point out everything that is wrong with the world; it is the hardest and most important work in one's life to free oneself from the bonds of fear and attachment.
It seemed to a number of philosophers of language, myself included, that we should attempt to achieve a unification of Chomsky's syntax, with the results of the researches that were going on in semantics and pragmatics. I believe that this effort has proven to be a failure. Though Chomsky did indeed revolutionize the subject of linguistics, it is not at all clear, at the end the century, what the solid results of this revolution are. As far as I can tell there is not a single rule of syntax that all, or even most, competent linguists are prepared to agree is a rule.
It seems the harder I work, the more luck I have.
It seems to me that good philosophy will always have a place in the investigation of any matter of deep human importance, because of its commitment to clarity, to carefully drawn distinctions, to calm argument rather than prejudice and dogmatic assertion"
It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death-- ought to decide, indeed, to earn one's death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One must negotiate this passage as nobly as possible, for the sake of those who are coming after us.
It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them.
It's ever been the way of the man of science or philosophy. Most folks stay in the dark and then complain they can't see nothing." -- Snipes (185)
It's extremely unlucky to be superstitious, for no other reason than it is always unlucky to be colossally stupid.
It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.
It's fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.
It's good to do uncomfortable things. It's weight training for life.
It's good to test yourself and develop your talents and ambitions as fully as you can and achieve greater success; but I think success is the feeling you get from a job well done, and the key thing is to do the work.
It's harder to be a success, globally, and be artistic. Harder to have that balance than just to be artistic when nobody understands you.
It's harder to make the glass than break the glass.
It's hard for a man to live with a successful woman - they seem to resent you so much. Very few men are generous enough to accept success in their women.
It's hard to beat a person who never gives up.
It's hard to grasp abstractions if you don't understand what they're abstracting away from.
It's hard work making movies. It's like being a doctor: you work long hours, very hard hours, and it's emotional, tense work. If you don't really love it, then it ain't worth it.
It's hard work to make a four-minute program look effortless and elegant.
It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.
It shouldn't be necessary for others to lose in order for you to win. If others have to lose, re-evaluate the game's goals.
It's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success.
It's important to have an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.
It's impossible to walk through solid rock... You have to walk between the molecules that make up the rock.

It's lonely at the top, but the food is better.
It's never too late to be what you might have been.
It's never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life you're proud of, And if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start over.
It's no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. You've got to stick to it all your life. Only at times, at times, the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it, all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in, when they come. But they've got to come. You can't force them.
It's not a beer unless it's a Kinsmen!
It's not about how hard you can hit; it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
It's not about how much you do, but how much love you put into what you do that counts.
It's not about whether or not someone is a bigot, but whether or not the argument which that someone is arguing is worth being a bigot about.
It's not an optical illusion, it just looks that way.
It's not easy to write a poem about a poem.
It's not enough merely to exist. Every man has to seek in his own way to make his own self more noble and to relize his own true worth.
It's not enough that I should succeed - others should fail.
It's not him who's disturbed. But he likes to disturb others--to shake them out of their rut.
It's not just the 'Grammys' that I've pulled out of. I also pulled out of the English awards as well. The reason that I wanted to pull out was because I believe very much that the music industry as a whole is mainly concerned with material success.
It's not oil that runs the world, it's shame.
It's no trick for talented people to be interesting, but it's a gift to be interested. We want an organization filled with interested people.
It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.
It's not the drug that causes the junkie it's the laws that causes the junkie because of course the drug laws means that he can't go and get help because he is afraid of being arrested. He also can't have a normal life because the war on drugs has made drugs so expensive and has made drug contracts unenforceable which means they can only be enforced through criminal violence.
It's not the heights that bother me it's falling on the bottoms of them.
It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.
It's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.

It's the broken toys that need the most love and attention.
It's the little things that make big things happen.
It's the poet we love in Caeiro, not the philosopher. What we really get from these poems is a childlike sense of life, with all the direct materiality of the child's mind, and all the vital spirituality of hope and increase that exist in the body and soul of nescient childhood. Caeiro's work is a dawn that wakes us up and quickens us; a more that material, more than anti-spiritual dawn. It's an abstract effect, pure vacuum, nothingness.
It's the price of success: people start to think you're omnipotent.
It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones who win in the lifelong race.
It's the truth, even if it didn't happen...
It's very important to understand why you do the things you do. Your understanding will make you work harder and be passionate, your lack of understanding will make you doubt and to give up on what you are doing.
It's when I go down to the beach that the waves come up to greet me.
It's when I hurt you that I cry inside myself.
It's when I'm covered in pink that my heart is on the outside.
It's when the dead walk that the living come to life!

It's when you walk with dinosaurs that you start thinking about lunch.
It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live.
It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.
It takes 20 years to make an overnight success.
It takes a strong fish to swim against the current. Even a dead one can float with it.
It takes a well-spent lifetime, and perhaps more, to crystalize in us that for which we exist.
It takes both rain and sunshine to make a rainbow.
It takes generosity to discover the whole through others. If you realize you are only a violin, you can open yourself up to the world by playing your role in the concert.
It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished.
It takes too much energy to be against something unless it's really important.
It takes two wings to fly.
It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.

It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.
It was Beauty killed the Beast.
It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action, and discipline that enabled us to follow through.
It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.
It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on. Pumpkin.
It will, of course, be understood that directly or indirectly, soon or late, every advance in the sciences of human nature will contribute to our success in controlling human nature and changing it to the advantage of the common weal.
It would be, for me, mere pointless pleasure, an illusion of order for this one frail, foolish, flicker-flash in the long dull fall of eternity.
I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.
I used to be a pessimist, but now I can't even do that right.
I used to be indecisive, now I'm not so sure.
I used to know everything, till everything changed.
I used to make up stuff in my bio all the time, that I used to be a professional ice-skater and stuff like that. I found it so inspirational. Why not make myself cooler than I am?
I used to think I knew what was right and what was wrong, and who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are. Then the world got very gray, and I didn't know anything for a long time
I've a great family, two children to take care of. Then, of course, I do commentary for TV. I do speak about various women's issues around the world - like LGBT, motivational speeches. I have a lot on my plate right now. But eventually, yes, I would like to pass on the knowledge and something that I would like to do.
I've always believed that one woman's success can only help another woman's success.
I've always believed that success for anyone is all about drive, dedication, and desire, but for me, it's also been about confidence and faith.
I've always hated the "Who are you?" question. This is a philosophical inquiry. Answering that question is why we're on earth. You can't answer it in thirty seconds or in an elevator.
I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that's about so you can represent it.
I've always thought that a big laugh is a really loud noise from the soul saying, 'Ain't that the truth.'
I've always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up.
I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.
I've been blessed to be somebody that's been climbing that success mountain top for years of hard work, you know, but now it's all connecting. And now, the whole world is watching, you know what I'm saying, and it feels good 'cause it's good energy. This is all positive vibes, and good vibes and good energy, so it feels incredible.
I've been known to write 10 pages a day for 10 days running before I take a breath. I am not a disciplined writer. I'm one of those people who laughingly call themselves inspirational writers, which basically means someone who has no control over their own creative process.
I've been very lucky to have achieved a lot of the things that I dreamt of achieving as a young man. But, at the end of the day - and I truly believe this - it is not about achieving great wealth or success. Because they don't bring happiness, ultimately.
I've done a lot of albums and I kinda know when I'm onto something that was inspirational for me to record and create, and this was one of those projects where I really enjoyed making the album.
I've failed over and over and over again. And that is why I succeed.
I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
I've found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances. Be more active. Show up more often.
I've got a mind like a.. a.. what's that thing called?
I've got a theory that if you give 100 percent all of the time, somehow things will work out in the end.
I've had a lot of success; I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.
I've had amnesia for as long as I can remember
I've had great success being a total idiot.
I've learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances.
I've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational, and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile.
I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
I've often thought that there isn't any "I" at all; that we are simply the means of expression of something else; that when we think we are ourselves, we are simply the victims of a delusion.
I've tickled Pink, and guess what, I liked it!
I've worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down.
I view art as an inspirational tool.
I want anyone who believes in life, liberty, pursuit of happiness to succeed. And I want any force, any person, any element of an overarching Big Government that would stop your success, I want that organization, that element or that person to fail. I want you to succeed.
I wanted movement and not a calm course of existence. I wanted excitement and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love. I felt it in myself a superabundance of energy which found no outlet in our quiet life.
I wanted that future officer to weigh decisions with a supple mind and to be comfortable with nuance and uncertainty.
I wanted to do something inspirational for my children.
I want, once and for all, not to know many things. Wisdom sets limits to knowledge too.
I want to be an inspirational model. I want people to look at me and say, 'Wow, she looks healthy.'
I want to be motivational and inspirational for everybody: my big aim is more women on bicycles.
I want to build a legacy at the WWE, but I definitely want to continue to grow the Bella Empire. I want it to go beyond the ring. I would love to be a motivational speaker.
I want to find a way of speaking to fellow human beings that will be cool rather than heated, philosophical rather than polemical, that will bring enlightenment rather than seeking to divide us into the righteous and the sinners, the saved and the damned, the sheep and the goats.
I want to make sure I don't interfere with the success of that team next year. I don't see any way I could go to practice like most of 'em do, and not hurt the team. I'd go nuts if I tried doing that.
I want to make this world perfect.
I want to see success right away. And I want to never give up, never stop.
I want to start by, as always, thanking my family. My kids, they're not kids anymore, but they're kids as far as I'm concerned. They'll always be my kids.
I was eating in a Chinese restaurant downtown. There was a dish called Mother and Child Reunion. It's chicken and eggs. And I said, I gotta use that one.
I was motivated to be different in part because I was different.
I was never aware of any other option but to question everything.
I was obliged to be industrious. Whoever is equally industrious will succeed equally well.
I was perceived to be a first- to third-rounder. I kind of had a tough junior year and fell to the fifth round. At that time, it was motivational.
I was successful materially, but I know life is much more than worldly success. I saw all these blessings God had given me. The way to give thanks is obedience to God.
I was sure I'd set the world on fire, and it was hard for a young feller like me to realize the truth - that I hadn't set the world on fire, and I was totally unprepared to handle the consequences if 'The Big Trail' had been a success and launched me as a star.
I was thinking of you while I was traveling toward the moon.
I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work 15 and 16 hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example.
I watch Fox news for the comedy, MSNBC when I need to be reminded that mind midgets exist and CNN when I want to check out the latest in media lies and special interest propaganda. On the other 364 days of the year I read the American transcendentalists, David Hume, Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant, Niccolo Machiavelli and Diogenes of Sinope.
I went to a General Store, but they wouldn't sell me anything specific.
I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure.
I went to a restaurant that serves 'breakfast at any time'. So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.
I went to a restaurant that was so expensive that they didn't have prices on the menu - just little faces with varying expressions of horror.
I, while the gods laugh, the world's vortex am;
I will always desire to play with Bruce Springsteen. He's the most inspirational, most dedicated, most committed and most focused artist I've ever seen. I like to be around people like that.
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.
I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead. Not sick, not wounded, dead.
I will not join the rat race because I'm not a rat. And I will not blindly follow a specific faith because I'm not a bat. The only race I'll take part in is for humans being humane. It's called the human race, and sadly it's got the least participants.
I will offer a choice, not an echo.
I will tell you why I became a philosopher. I became a philosopher because I wanted to be able to talk about many, many things, ideally with knowledge, but sometimes not quite the amount of knowledge that I would need if I were to be a specialist in them. It allows you to be many different things. And plurality and complexity are very, very important to me.
I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with, all these fabulous women, 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.' I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple.
I wish I could tell you the secret to being forever young, but no one's figured that out yet. But if you see the glass half full, simplify your life, and give yourself to a worthy cause, you will be forever happy.
I wish I knew how to quit you.
I wish that the Indians believed me a god, for upon the report of an enemy's valor oftentimes depends the success of a battle, and false reports have many times done as great things as true courage and resolution.
I wish the Peace Corps and its volunteers continued success and perseverance. We are grateful for their contributions to society and dedication to providing assistance where it is needed. May the Peace Corps continue its legacy of service, both at home and abroad.
I wonder how many times people give up just before a breakthrough - when they are on the very brink of success.
I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges
I wonder why peopke are so afraid of love. Of different kinds of love. I just don't get it. Why aren't we afraid of racism" Of war? But love? It just doesn't make sense.
I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend.
I worked at The Old Globe Theater under the great baton of Craig Noel. One of the great theater heroes that we have. He was so great and so inspirational. I think I did 'Antony and Cleopatra' and 'The Taming of the Shrew'. I lived in Ocean Beach, and my rent was $140 a month.
I worked half my life to be an overnight success, and still it took me by surprise.
I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance.
I would like to wish the England squad every success. I would also very much like to extend those wishes to Martin Johnson, Brian Smith, Mike Ford, John Wells, Graham Rowntree and the rest of the England 2011 World Cup management team who have been fantastic and deserve people to know that.
I would love to be a guest on a talk show or a panel that shows women who have been on reality shows who've had success, to prove to audiences that you don't have to be a fool to become successful.
I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.
I would not think that philosophy and reason themselves will be man's guide in the foreseeable future; however, they will remain the most beautiful sanctuary they have always been for the select few.
I wouldn't be human if I didn't feel pride and something that transcends pride humility.
I would prefer a sword to fight duel, but a pen to plan a war.
I would probably work with Drake as he is massively inspirational to me as a writer as well as an artist. If not him, then Susan Boyle!
I would rather be able to appreciate things I can not have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.
I would rather be an opportunist and float than go to the bottom with my principles around my neck.
I would rather be an optimist and be wrong than a pessimist who proves to be right. The former sometimes wins, but never the latter.
I would rather die of passion than of boredom.
I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief.
I would say I'm an inspirational guidelines book. You can take my life story or scenarios or songs and relate to them and apply them to your everyday life.
I wrote '('Til) I Kissed You' about a girl I met in Australia. Her name was Lilian, and she was very, very inspirational. I was married, but... I wrote the song about her on the way back home.
Izzi: Remember Moses Morales?
Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones. Java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since MS-DOS.
Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn't methodical, but jazz isn't messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians. Jazz is abandon.
Je crois au flooding.
Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;--love God as I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"
Jigga, Kells, Not Guilty
Jokes of the proper kind, properly told, can do more to enlighten questions of politics, philosophy, and literature than any number of dull arguments.
Joy descends gently upon us like the evening dew, and does not patter down like a hailstorm.
Joy is but the sign that creative emotion is fulfilling its purpose.
Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. She gives most who gives with Joy.
Joy is the goal of existence, and joy is not to be stumbled upon, but to be achieved, and the act of treason is to let its vision drown in the swamp of the moment's torture.
Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.
Judge me not by physical size or appearance, but judge me by the size of my character.
Judge not according to the appearance.
Judgments prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.
Just as a moth is attracted to the light, man is attracted to wealth
Just as one spoils the stomach by overfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and choke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.
Just as you wouldn't leave the house without taking a shower, you shouldn't start the day without at least 10 minutes of sacred practice: prayer, meditation, inspirational reading.
Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do doesn't mean it's useless.
Just because you took longer than others, doesn't mean you failed.
Just don't give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong.
Just go out there and do what you've got to do.
Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust. Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. Therefore in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled; the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests.
Just keep going. Everybody gets better if they keep at it.
Just keep swimming.
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer... Then I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers...
Just like carpentry, measure twice cut once.
Just remember, you can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.
Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove. But I find that the whole order of Nature confirms my confidence that, if it is not like our noblest hopes and dreams, it will transcend them.
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly.
Kalau manusia sama sekali tidak pernah merasa putus asa, kita tidak akan tahu bagian mana dari diri kita yang tak sanggup kita singkirkan. Lalu kita akan tumbuh dewasa tanpa benar-benar mengerti apa saja yang bisa membuat kita gembira. Aku bahagia karena bisa menderita", Eriko (Kitchen)
Karate is a form of martial arts in which people who have had years and years of training can, using only their hands and feet, make some of the worst movies in the history of the world.
Kebanyakan orang dapat bertahan hidup hanya jika mereka dapat melupakan realitas ini dan memusatkan diri ke yang lain: ke karier mereka, ke investasi, gelar, anak atau apa saja yang terlihat bertambah banyak.
Keep all special thoughts and memories for lifetimes to come. Share these keepsakes with others to inspire hope and build from the past, which can bridge to the future.
Keep a promise.
Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.
KEEP GOING.
Keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.
Keep me away from the wisdom which does not cry, the philosophy which does not laugh and the greatness which does not bow before children.
Keep on going, and the chances are that you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I never heard of anyone ever stumbling on something sitting down.
Keep on keeping on.
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.
Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
Keep your fears to yourself, but share your courage with others.
Keep your feet on the ground, but let your heart soar as high as it will. Refuse to be average or to surrender to the chill of your spiritual environment.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
Keep your head high but your heart soft.
Keinginan telah mengajarkan kepadamu betapa sia-sianya keinginan, penyesalan mengajarkan betapa sia-sianya penyesalan. Bersabarlah wahai kekeliruan, karena kami semua menjadi bagianmu. Bersabarlah wahai Ketidaksempurnaan, berkat engkaulah Kesempurnaan menyadari dirinya. Bersabarlah kemarahan, karena engkau tidak kekal abadi.
Kendati batas antara kebebasan dan ketidakpedulian terkadang saru
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.
Kindness is the highest form of prayer for it reflects the inner longing for universal love.
Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.
Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.
Kitalah planet yang hidup itu, Sophie! Kitalah kapal besar yang berlayar mengelilingi matahari yang membakar alam raya. Tapi kita masing-masing adalah juga sebuah kapal bermuatan gen-gen yang melayari kehidupan. Jika kita sudah membawa muatan ini dengan selamat ke pelabuhan berikut --berarti hidup kita tidak sia-sia.
Kita melahirkan dan dilahirkan oleh sebuah jiwa yang tidak kita kenal
Knock the 't' off the 'can't'
Knowing and not doing are equal to not knowing at all.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
Knowing what must be done does away with fear.
Know in your heart that all things are possible. We couldn't conceive of a miracle if none had ever happened.
Knowledge and ego are directly related. the less knowledge, the greater the ego.
Knowledge becomes evil if the aim be not virtuous.
Knowledge can be acquired by a suitable and complete study, no matter what the starting point is. Only one must know how to 'learn.' What is nearest to us is man; and you are the nearest of all men to yourself. Begin with the study of yourself; remember the saying 'Know thyself.
"Knowledge for its own sake"--that is the last snare laid by morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.
Knowledge is being aware of what you can do. Wisdom is knowing when not to do it.
Knowledge is power is time is money.
Knowledge is responsibility, which is why people resist knowledge.
Knowledge subverts love: in proportion as we penetrate our secrets, we come to loathe our kind, precisely because they resemble us.
Knowledge without wisdom can be dangerous.
Know or listen to those who know.
Know thyself? If I knew myself, I'd run away.
Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?
Labels only destroy the world and disrupt peace.
La connaissance d'un défaut ne l'enlève pas, elle nous torture jusqu'à sa correction.
Lady Gaga is the present and the future. She is the most revolutionary and inspirational artist. She is fearless and daring.
La memoria es como libro en el cual se escribe toda nuestra vida. Algunas veces deseamos cerrarlo y olvidarlo para no recordar todos los escabrosos detalles, y otras veces deseamos abrirlo y observarlo detenidamente, queriendo volver a sentir lo mismo que sentimos en aquel momento.
Language disguises thought.
La prueba de ausencia no es prueba de ausencia
Last night I was seriously considering whether I was a bisexual or not but I don't think so though I'm not sure if I'd like to be and argh I don't think there's anything wrong with that, if you like a person, you like the person, not their genitals.
Later on in life, you expect a bit of rest, don't you? You think you deserve it. I did, anyway. But then you begin to understand that the reward of merit is not life's business.
Latter-day capitalism. Like it or not, it's the society we live in. Even the standard of right and wrong has been subdivided, made sophisticated. Within good, there's fashionable good and unfashionable good, and ditto for bad. Within fashionable good, there's formal and then there's casual; there's hip, there's cool, there's trendy, there's snobbish. Mix 'n' match. Like pulling on a Missoni sweater over Trussardi slacks and Pollini shoes, you can now enjoy hybrid styles of morality. It's the way of the world -- philosophy starting to look more and more like business administration.
Laugh at yourself, but don't ever aim your doubt at yourself. Be bold. When you embark for strange places, don't leave any of yourself safely on shore. Have the nerve to go into unexplored territory.
Laugh loudly, laugh often.
Laughter is the antidote to existential pain
Laughter is the hand of God on the shoulder of a troubled world.
Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face.
Laws die, books never.
Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.
Leadership means that a group, large or small, is willing to entrust authority to a person who has shown judgment, wisdom, personal appeal, and proven competence.
Leap, and the net will appear.
Learn all you can from the mistakes of others. You won't have time to make them all yourself.
Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.
Learn everything you can, anytime you can, from anyone you can - there will always come a time when you will be grateful you did.
Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.
Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow.
Learning does not make one learned: there are those who have knowledge and those who have understanding. The first requires memory and the second philosophy.
Learning how to be still, to really be still and let life happen - that stillness becomes a radiance.
Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins.
Learning is what most adults will do for a living in the 21st century.
Learning to celebrate success is a key component of learning how to win in the market.
Leave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark. That's where the most important things come from, where you yourself came from, and where you will go.
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
Leaving your religion and having to invent your own system of values is a big deal, after all.
Le Corbusier was the sort of relentlessly rational intellectual that only France loves wholeheartedly, the logician who flies higher and higher in ever-decreasing concentric circles until, with one last, utterly inevitable induction, he disappears up his own fundamental aperture and emerges in the fourth dimension as a needle-thin umber bird.
Lee's great gifts are teaching and inspirational guidance, not administration and management.
Lend me your ears and you can borrow my mind
Lent comes providentially to reawaken us, to shake us from our lethargy.
Leopards may change their spots, but bullies will always show their true colors.
Les hommes construisent trop de murs et pas assez de ponts.
Let Actions Do Your Talkin For You, (Unless Your Telling A Good Dirty Joke)
Let children read whatever they want and then talk about it with them. If parents and kids can talk together, we won't have as much censorship because we won't have as much fear.
Let each man exercise the art he knows.
Let education kindle only those which are truly beneficial
Let every dawn be to you as the beginning of life, and every setting sun be to you as its close.
Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.
Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
Let mental culture go on advancing, let the natural sciences progress in even greater extent and depth, and the human mind widen itself as much as it desires: beyond the elevation and moral culture of Christianity, as it shines forth in the Gospels, it will not go.
Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.
Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goals: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.
Let no one delay the study of philosophy while young nor weary of it when old.
Let not the rash marble risk
Let our New Year's resolution be this: we will be there for one another as fellow members of humanity, in the finest sense of the word.
Let people be the pursuits of happiness, you be the pursuit of perfection.
Let's say I have a mystical soul and a rational brain, and, like Montaigne, I am incapable of choosing between them. I don't know if I believe in God, but I am often tempted to believe.
Let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.
Let the beauty that we love be what we do.
Let the love of the moon kiss you good night,
let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.
Let those who want to save the world if you can get to see it clear and as a whole. Then any part you make will represent the whole if it's made truly. The thing to do is work and learn to make it.
Let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul, and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation.
Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow's reality.
Let us not only fall in love, let us live life as if life is our love affair.
Let us realize that: the privilege to work is a gift, the power to work is a blessing, the love of work is success!
Let us remember: One book, one pen, one child, and one teacher can change the world.
Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow.
Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.
Let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something.
Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf.
Let yourself be open and life will be easier.
Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias.
Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes and seeing them gratified.
Life always involves some logic in its manifestations, and logic, as a rule, excludes the versatility of life from its considerations.
Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.
Life brings simple pleasures to us every day. It is up to us to make them wonderful memories.
Life does not end at 21, it only gets better.
Life doesn't run away from nobody. Life runs at people.
Life goes up and life goes down.
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.
Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent of how I react to it.
Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
Life is a bitter sweet journey my friend, a bitter sweet journey.
Life is a book. We fill the pages.
Life is about making an impact, not making an income.
Life is a complex
Life is a daring adventure or it is nothing at all.
Life is a magical game so play it with love.
Life is a magical journey, so travel endlessly to unfold its profound and heart touching beauty.
Life is an essay you yourself have to write, start to finish.
Life... is a paradise to what we fear of death.
Life is a series of problem-solving opportunities. The problems you face will either defeat you or develop you depending on how you respond to them.
Life is a series of punches. It presents a lot of challenges. It presents a lot of hardship, but the people that are able to take those punches and able to move forward are the ones that really do have a lot of success and have a lot of joy in their life and have a lot of stories to tell, too.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
Life is just a chance to grow a soul.
Life is less about what you do, and more about how and why you do those things. This is called character.
Life is like riding a bicycle. In order to maintain balance, you must keep moving.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
Life is like yoga; the only way you can enjoy it is by relaxing into any position you happen to find yourself in.
Life is magical for those whose hearts are loving, minds are full with joy, and eyes that are dancing with beauty.
Life is magical when you are drunk with love.
Life is much more successfully looked at from a single window.
Life is not about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Life is not a struggle, but a wiggle.
Life is not fair; get used to it.
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
Life isn't about getting and having, it's about giving and being.
Life isn't always fair. Some people are born into better environments. Some people have better genetics. Some are in the right place at the right time. If you're trying to change your life, all of this is irrelevant. All that matters is that you accept where you are, figure out where you want to be, and then do what you can, today and every day, to hold your head high and keep moving forward.
Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
Life is short, and the world is wide.
Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are traveling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind.
Life is the greatest of all mysteries, and though I seek to solve its many riddles, my deepest fear is that I will succeed.
Life is tough but so are you.
Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat.
Life is undoubtedly born of biology, but if a lifeform strictly constructs all its perception living inside the ship-shape well of biology, despite having developed the brain capacity to be beyond it, then it is a disgusting mockery of life itself.
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.
Life is what you portrait it!
Life: It is better not to wrap philosophy around such an inconceivable evolving beautiful mystery. If based on perception, alone; whatever the conclusion - it is still guessing.
Life may have no meaning. Or even worse, it may have a meaning of which I disapprove.
Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
Life offers no guarantees... just choices; no certainty... but consequences; no predictable outcomes... just the privilege of pursuit.
Life's blows cannot break a person whose spirit is warmed by the fire of enthusiasm.
Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are.
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.
Lifes like a painters palette, just when you've got everything worked out the colours change
Life's managed, not cured.
Life's reward will be yours.
Life's too mysterious, don't take it serious.
Life's too mysterious to take too serious.
Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late.
Life will not change if you change the content of your life. It will change if you change the context of your thoughts about your life.
Light in comparison with darkness is a void.
Light tomorrow with today!
Like all magnificent things, it's very simple.
Like apes, we breed, sleep, and die. Yet like God we say, "I am." We are ontological oxymorons.
Like a wild animal, the soul is tough, resilient, resourceful, savvy, and self-sufficient: it knows how to survive in hard places. I learned about these qualities during my bouts with depression. In that deadly darkness, the faculties I had always depended on collapsed. My intellect was useless; my emotions were dead; my will was impotent; my ego was shattered. But from time to time, deep in the thickets of my inner wilderness, I could sense the presence of something that knew how to stay alive even when the rest of me wanted to die. That something was my tough and tenacious soul.
Like melting ice, melt within to purify yourself and to gain the power of purity and humility.
Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again.
Like the moon without her nights. Like the stars without their lights.
Like the United Nations, there is something inspirational about New York as a great melting pot of different cultures and traditions. And if this is the city that never sleeps, the United Nations works tirelessly, around the clock around the world.
Limitations live only in our minds.  But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless.
Linux is only free if your time has no value.
LISP has been jokingly described as "the most intelligent way to misuse a computer". I think that description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.
Lisp is a programmable programming language.
Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.
Listening is an attitude of the heart, a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals.
Listen." Jennifer reverted, "I didn't mean anything by all of that before. I understand what you were trying to do and ..." She struggled for the right words. "Sweetie, like love, people don't live inside of life, life lives inside of you. Open yourself up to it and there's no stopping your heart.
Listen, not with your ears, with your heart.
Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above it.
Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above them.
Live all you can - it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that, what have you had?
Live like a tree, giving, forgiving and free.
Live today. Not yesterday. Not tomorrow. Just today. Inhabit your moments. Don't rent them out to tomorrow.
Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.
Live your life from your heart. Share from your heart. And your story will touch and heal people's souls.
Living well is an art that can be developed: a love of life and ability to take great pleasure from small offerings and assurance that the world owes you nothing and that every gift is exactly that, a gift.
Logic in all its infinite potential, is the most dangerous of vices. For one can always find some form of logic to justify his action, and rest comfortably in the assurance, that what he did abides by reason. That is why, for us brittle beings, Intention is the only true weapon of peace.
Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.

Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It's part ballet. It's part battleground, part playground. We clarify, amplify and glorify the game with our footage, the narration and that music, and in the end create an inspirational piece of footage.
Look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time.
Look at the mirror, and you will find the love of your lifetime.
Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work.
Look at what you've got and make the best of it. It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.
Look for someone's strength instead of weakness.
Look for the good and praise it.
Look, girls know when they're cute," he said. "You don't have to tell them. All they need to do is look in the mirror. I have one friend out in New York, an attorney. She moved out there after the school year to take the bar. She doesn't have a job. I was like, 'How are you going to get a job there in this market?' And she's like, 'I'll wink and I'll smile.' She's a pretty girl. Whether that works despite her poor grades is yet to be seen.
Look. If I touch you with this hand, I can remember touching you, but I can't prove I ever did. If reality is nothing more than what is in our mind...then what is the difference between this world and a dream?
Look in the MIRROR...
Look in the mirror... That's your competition.
Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.
Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig.
Lord, grant that I may always desire more than I can accomplish.
LORD ILLINGWORTH: The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.
Lord knows, every day is not a success, every year is not a success. You have to celebrate the good.
Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.
Louis Pasteur's theory of germs is ridiculous fiction.
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Love and desire are the spirit's wings to great deeds.
Love as a concrete foundation for an authentically functional civilization requires the around-the-clock labors of forgiveness. Without it, Love fails, Friendship fails, Intelligence fails, Humanity: fails.
Love as if everyone is your brother or sister. Take care of this world as if it is your beloved home.
Love because it is the only true adventure.
Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his normal character.
Love consists in this, that its own should be another's; to feel the joy of another as joy in oneself, that is loving.
Love delayed is lust augmented.
Love doesn't come in a box.
Love fire lit me today.
Love gives you eyes.
Love is a chemical reaction,
Love is a cowboy's hardest ride.
Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.
Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly, and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love.
Love is an expression and assertion of self-esteem, a response to one's own values in the person of another.
Love is an infinite attraction with infinite power.
Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.
Love is like war, easy to begin but hard to stop.
Love is my inner strength and my power.
Love is not a relationship, love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not "in love", one is love. And of course when one is love, one is in love -- but that is an outcome, a by-product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.
Love isn't always a physical emotion. Sometimes it's the ones who never got to actually hold you in their arms that appreciate you for who you are
Love is our most unifying and empowering common spiritual denominator. The more we ignore its potential to bring greater balance and deeper meaning to human existence, the more likely we are to continue to define history as one long inglorious record of man's inhumanity to man.
Love is patient; love is kind and envies no one. Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude; never selfish, not quick to take offense. Love keeps no score of wrongs; does not gloat over other men's sins, but delights in the truth. There is nothing love cannot face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, and endurance. [....] In a word, there are three things that last forever: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of them all is love.
Love is patient, Love is Kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
Love is the only thing that is permanent in this world of ours.
Love' is the only weapon I have, I will defend with love, I will attack with love.
Love, I think, is a gateway to the world, not an escape from it.
Love itself is what is left over when being "in love" has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.
Love life and life will love you back. Love people and they will love you back.
Love life, Live Love
Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.
love make us poets, and the approach of death should make us philosophers.
Love means never having to say you're sorry.
Love never reasons but profusely gives; gives, like a thoughtless prodigal, its all, and trembles lest it has done too little.
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope.
Love taught me to die with dignity that I might come forth anew in splendor. Born once of flesh, then again of fire, I was reborn a third time to the sound of my name humming haikus in heaven's mouth.
Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries.
Love the moment. Flowers grow out of dark moments. Therefore, each moment is vital. It affects the whole. Life is a succession of such moments and to live each, is to succeed.
Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of all others. Love to God also!
Love will never let you down, if you don't give it up
Love yourself, accept yourself, forgive yourself, and be good to yourself, because without you the rest of us are without a source of many wonderful things.
Loyalty is a feature in a boy's character that inspires boundless hope.
Luck can only get you so far.
Luck? I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it, and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else: hard work.
Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get.
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
Luck is where opportunity meets preparation.
Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.
Luxury is the wolf at the door and its fangs are the vanities and conceits germinated by success. When an artist learns this, he knows where the danger is.
Madness takes its toll. Please have exact change.

Maintain composure in times of heightened emotion, reacting only when thoughts are calm and clear. Being sensible will open doors for solutions and creativity.
Make a spurious division of one process into two, forget that you have done it, and then puzzle for centuries as to how the two get together.
Make life easier by living in the present and believing in the future.
Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul.
Make the decision, make it with confidence, and the world will be yours.
Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.
Make treating yourself a priority and always remember your life is happening now. Don't put off all your dreams and pleasures to another day. In any balanced personal definition of success there has to be a powerful element of living life in the present.
Make your life a mission, not an intermission.
Making All Software Into Tools Reduces Risk.
making myself miserable about my mistakes. That doesn't work. So will take notes from that, put it behind me, move on
Male zebras have white stripes, female zebras have black stripes.
Mama says, 'Stupid is as stupid does.'
Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.
Man has created woman--out of what? Out of a rib of his god--of his "ideal."
Man in general, if reduced to himself, is too wicked to be free.
Man is able to decide for or against reason, he is able to create beyond reason or to destroy below reason
Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.
Man is a mystery. It needs to be unravelled, and if you spend your whole life unravelling it, don't say that you've wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.
Man is an end in himself.
Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed.
Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something
Man is free at the instant he wants to be.
Man is ignorant to the ways of the universe, but the universe knows man all too well.
Man is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art.
Man is not born to solve the problem of the universe, but to find out what he has to do; and to restrain himself within the limits of his comprehension.
Man is so made that when anything fires his soul, impossibilities vanish.
Man is the measure of all things', said the Sophist Protagora (c. 485-410 B.C.). By that he meant that the question of whether a thing is right or wrong, good or bad, must always be considered in relation to a person's needs.
Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.
Mankind flung its advance agents ever outward, ever outward. Eventually it flung them out into space, into the colorless, tasteless, weightless sea of outwardness without end.
Mankind is made great or little by its own will.
Manlius ... took care in his invitations, actively sought to exclude from his circle crude and vulgar men like Caius Valerius. But they were all around; it was Manlius who lived in a dream world, and his bubble of civility was becoming smaller and smaller. Caius Valerius, powerful member of a powerful family, had never even heard of Plato. A hundred, even fifty years before, such an absurdity would have been inconceivable. Now it was surprising if such a man did know anything of philosophy, and even if it was explained, he would not wish to understand.
Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success.
Man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit.
Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch -- or build a cyclotron -- without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think.
Man's mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions.
Man's naked form belongs to no particular moment in history; it is eternal, and can be looked upon with joy by the people of all ages.
Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.
Man was born for society. However little He may be attached to the World, He never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the former.
Man will occassionally stumble over the truth, but most of the time he will pick himself up and continue on.
Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his pride.
Many are called but few get up.
Many are harmed by fear itself, and many may have come to their fate while dreading fate.
Many individuals are doing what they can. But real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economics and in our politics.
Many married women who have deliberately spurned the "hour" of childbearing are unhappy and frustrated. They never discovered the joys of marriage because they refused to surrender to the obligation of their state. In saving themselves, they lost themselves!
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
Many of our most serious conflicts are conflicts within ourselves. Those who suppose their judgements are always consistent are unreflective or dogmatic.
Many people will try to Sell you a Dream, its Your place to let them know you Already have one.
Many receive advice; few profit by it.
Many small people, in many small places, do many small things, that can alter the face of the world.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. What then kills love? Only this: Neglect.
March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path.
Marriage can be made to work if both the partners can see beyond themselves and understand the limitations,needs and abilities of the other person and are willing to embrace the positive and negative aspects of each other in their understanding.
Marvin's Motivational Moments actually started as something that was actually therapeutic for me. I would sit up late at night after my wife passed trying to adjust to being alone.
Material wealth can be bad for your health.
Mathematicians finally developed a financial model to accurately compare apples and oranges. Any two kinds of fruit can be compared, although guavas still cause minor rounding errors.
Maybe each human being lives in a unique world, a private world different from those inhabited and experienced by all other humans. . . If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn't we really be talking about plural realities? And if there are plural realities, are some more true (more real) than others? What about the world of a schizophrenic? Maybe it's as real as our world. Maybe we cannot say that we are in touch with reality and he is not, but should instead say, His reality is so different from ours that he can't explain his to us, and we can't explain ours to him. The problem, then, is that if subjective worlds are experienced too differently, there occurs a breakdown in communication ... and there is the real illness.
Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.
Maybe I'm strange and perverse, but I've always thought there was something sexy about a compelling argument.
Maybe I should have gone into politics. If you were a political activist, election season brought moments of intensity, whichever side you were on, and meanwhile here I was inarguably withering away,
Maybe man is nothing in particular,' Cross said gropingly. 'Maybe that's the terror of it. Man may be just anything at all. And maybe man deep down suspects this, really knows this, kind of dreams that it is true; but at the same time he does not want really to know it? May not human life on this earth be a kind of frozen fear of man at what he could possibly be? And every move he makes might not these moves be just to hide this awful fact? To twist it into something which he feels would make him rest and breathe a little easier? What man is is perhaps too much to be borne by man...
Maybe sometimes we don't do the right thing because the wrong thing looks more dangerous, and we don't want to look scared, so we go and do the wrong thing just because it's dangerous. We're more concerned with not looking scared than with judging right.
Maybe that's it, [...] [w]ith what you were talking about before. The world being broken. Maybe it isn't that we're supposed to find the pieces and put them back together. Maybe
Maybe we should always start everything from the inside and work to the outside, and not from the outside to the inside. What d'you think?
May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect.

Meet the first beginnings. Look to the budding mischief before it has time to ripen to maturity.
Me, I've seen 45 years, and I've only figured out one thing. That's this: if a person would just make the effort, there's something to be learned from everything. From even the most ordinary, commonplace things, there's always something you can learn. I read somewhere that they said there's even different philosophies in razors. Fact is, if it weren't for that, nobody'd survive.
Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others.
Men are made for happiness, and he who is completely happy has the right to say to himself, 'I am doing God's will on earth.
Mendel had a remarkable nature as a boy. I'm not talking about miracles. Miracles are a burden for a tzaddik, not the proof of one. Miracles prove nothing except to those whose faith is bought very cheap, sir. There was something in Mendele. There was a fire.
Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear with them.
Men have such a good opinion of themselves, of their mental superiority and intellectual depth; they believe themselves so skilled in discerning the true from the false, the path of safety from those of error, that they should be forbidden as much as possible the perusal of philosophic writings.
Men judge us by the success of our efforts. God looks at the efforts themselves.
Men must live and create. Live to the point of tears.
Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.
Men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.
[Men] prefer the foolish belief and the passions of the earth [to the enlightenment of their souls]. They believe the absurd and shrink from the truth."
Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee.
Men would no longer be victims of nature or of their own largely irrational societies: reason would triumph; universal harmonious cooperation, true history, would at last begin.

Mere philosophy will not satisfy us. We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. (3)
Metaphysics means nothing but an unusually obstinate effort to think clearly. The fundamental conceptions of psychology are practically very clear to us, but theoretically they are very confused, and one easily makes the obscurest assumptions in this science without realizing, until challenged, what internal difficulties they involve.
Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.

Mind you, the whole world is our family, and our family is our responsibility -- not of a bunch of so-called specialists. And this is not a glorified hypothetical ideal, rather it is an actuality.
Miracles are a retelling in small letters of the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see.
Misconceptions play a prominent role in my view of the world.

Mistakes are a great educator when one is honest enough to admit them and willing to learn from them.

Mistakes are the portals of discovery.
Mistakes were made.
Misunderstanding is my cornerstone. It's everyone's, come to think of it. Illusions mistaken for truth are the pavement under our feet.
Mma Ramotswe had listened to a World Service broadcast on her radio one day which had simply taken her breath away. It was about philosophers who called themselves existentialists and who, as far as Mma Ramotswe could ascertain, lived in France. These French people said that you should just live in a way which made you feel real, and that the real thing to do was the right thing too. Mma Ramotswe had listened in astonishment. You did not have to go to France to meet existentialists, she reflected; there were many existentialists right here in Botswana. Note Mokoti, for example. She had been married to an existentialist herself, without even knowing it. Note, that selfish man who never once put himself out for another--not even for his wife--would have approved of existentialists, and they of him. It was very existentialist, perhaps, to go out to bars every night while your pregnant wife stayed at home, and even more existentialist to go off with girls--young existentialist girls--you met in bars. It was a good life being an existentialist, although not too good for all the other, nonexistentialist people around one.
Moderation is the feebleness and sloth of the soul, whereas ambition is the warmth and activity of it.
Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange, and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.
Molecules dissolve and pass away, but consciousness survives the death of the matter on which it rides.

More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason - including blind stupidity.
More powerful than the mighty armies is an idea whose time has come.
More powerful than the will to win is the courage to begin.
More power than all the success slogans ever penned by human hand is the realization for every man that he has but one boss. That boss is the man - he - himself.
More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts.
Most children don't know freedom, because their life is a never-ending debt to their parents.
Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.
Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him, or gradually leaving off palm-leaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin, complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes be content with less?
Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them.
Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no help at all.
Most of the movies are working like, 'Information,
Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical.
Most of us form estimates of our intelligence, wisdom, and moral fiber that are considerably higher than an objective estimate would warrant; no doubt 90 percent of us think ourselves well above average along these lines.
Most of us have far more courage than we ever dreamed we possessed.
Most of us have learned to be dispassionate about evil, to look it in the face and find, as often as not, our own grinning reflections with which we do not argue, but good is another matter. Few have stared at that long enough to accept that its face too is grotesque, that in us the good is something under construction. The modes of evil usually receive worthy expression. The modes of good have to be satisfied with a cliche or a smoothing down that will soften their real look.
Most of us try to do too much because we are secretly afraid we will not be able to do anything at all.
Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game one foot from a winning touchdown.
Most success springs from an obstacle or failure. I became a cartoonist largely because I failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive.

Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there's always something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her.
Motivation is knowing you are learning, growing, and succeeding toward your desired outcome while sustaining positive momentum.
Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it.
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.
Motivation will almost always beat mere talent.
Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.
Movies are hard work. The public doesn't see that. The critics don't see it. But they're a lot of work. A lot of work.
Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?
Mr. Trask, do you think the thoughts of people suddenly become important at a given age? Do you have sharper feelings or clearer thoughts now than when you were ten? Do you see as well, hear as well, taste as vitally?
Much effort, much prosperity.
...much theological discussion is wasted, not because the words used have no possible meaning, but because the people who use them don't mean anything by them.
Muhabbat apni marzi se khulay pinjray main totay ki tarha bethnay ki salaahiyat hai. Muhabbat is ghulami ka toq hai jo insaan khud apnay ekhtyar se galay main dalta hai
Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul.
Music calms the soul and improves the plasticity, flexibility, and sensitivity of the perceptual world.
Music creates a bridge between our soul and the infinite.
Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.
Music expresses that which cannot be put into words.
Music is ... A higher revelation than all Wisdom
Music is my religion.
Music is the effort we make to explain to ourselves how our brains work. We listen to Bach transfixed because this is listening to a human mind.
My actual life is a fact, in view of which I have no occasion to congratulate myself; but for my faith and aspiration I have respect. It is from these that I speak.
My advice to you is get married: if you find a good wife you'll be happy; if not, you'll become a philosopher.
My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me.
My biggest success is getting over the things that have tried to destroy and take me out of this life. Those are my biggest successes. It has nothing to do with work.
My career started young and I was really ambitious, and then I had success and I hung out with people who were much older. I think I might have been temporally misplaced, so I thought I was 40. It was a premature midlife crisis.
My cat loves me. That's why he gives me fur balls.
My childhood, adolescence and high school days are unusually important. If there has ever been a time that I developed a uniqueness and sense of humor and the ability to organize, it was then. In those early days, I developed the skills that gave me a certain degree of success in American politics.
My dad is too cute. Every morning, he sends me one motivational quote. I have a folder full of all his quotes.
My dad told me, 'It takes fifteen years to be an overnight success', and it took me seventeen and a half years.
My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain.
My depth has no depth
My desire and wish is that the things I start with should be so obvious that you wonder why I spend my time stating them. This is what I aim at because the point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.
My existence began to worry me seriously. Was I not a simple spectre?
My experience with forgiveness is that it sort of comes spontaneously at a certain point and to try to force it it's not really forgiveness. It's Buddhist philosophy or something spiritual jargon that you're trying to live up to but you're just using it against yourself as a reason why you're not okay.
My family would be supportive if I said I wanted to be a Martian, wear only banana skins, make love to ashtrays, and eat tree bark.
My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person; he believed in me.
My father, Oliver Hynes, was an educator. He was originally just a teacher, a very good one, but then he was promoted to be in charge of education for the entire area. He was always an inspirational teacher. He was my big personal supporter, always coming here for the Tony Awards. My mother, Carmel, was a homemaker.
My father was an immigrant who literally walked across Europe to get out of Russia. He fought in World War I. He was wounded in action. My father was a great success even though he never had money. He was a very determined man, a great role model.
My favourite scientific theory is that the rings of Saturn are made of lost airline luggage.
My first book was called, 'Mountain, Get Out of My Way,' where I did an autobiographical sketch, if you will, looking back at myself and looking back at things in my life, and juxtaposing them against things that are happening in other people's lives and trying to be motivational.
My first job was washing dishes in the basement of a nursing home for $2.10 an hour, and I learned as much about the value of hard work there as I ever did later.
My goal in coming to General Motors was to help restore profitability, build a strong market position and position this iconic company for success. We are clearly on that path.
My goal in my career is to inspire people, is to get my music out there and have people enjoy it, and have people think of me as an inspirational artist.
My greatest success story has been my family.
My heart knows what my mind only think it knows.
My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.
My initial goal for the 1984 opening ceremonies was a show that would be majestic, inspirational, and emotional - a 20 goosebump experience.
My life's in a mobile.
My long eyelashes are my punishment for being beautiful.
My mind is a lock pick always looking for another door to open. I often find those doors by exploring minds of others...
My mind's my kingdom.
My mind was formed by studying philosophy,
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I am right.
My parents are very proud of my success but still worry, as I'm in a profession where there is no guarantee of work. They have always supported my decision to go into acting, but there have been tough times work-wise.
My parents had always preached the virtues of hard work. But hard work is one thing; economic struggle is another.
My pet chicken refuses to go to KFC just in case he sees someone that he knows.
My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.
My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.
My precious.
My proudest achievement has been the success of the shows and artists I have been involved with, because they were made in Britain.
My reflection will never smile when the face in the mirror belongs to someone else.
My responsibility to myself, my neighbors, my family and the human family is to try to tell the truth.
My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in the fewness of my wants.
My ship came in,then it sank!
My smile says it all.
My sources are unreliable, but their information is fascinating.
My store, Wine Library, outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle. I always say that our success wasn't due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.
My success has been something I've worked a long time at and it's been a gradual process. I compare it to the idea of someone losing a lot of weight over a period of a few years. You don't really notice the weight loss overall but if you compare photos from then and now there's a big difference.
My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people.
My success isn't a result of arrogance - it's a result of belief.
My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day.
My success was due to good luck, hard work, and support and advice from friends and mentors. But most importantly, it depended on me to keep trying after I had failed.
My success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense.
My supply of brain cells is finally down to a manageable size
My tastes and inspirational artists were always rather eclectic and diverse.
My teacher asked my favorite color. ... I said 'Rainbow'.... and I was punished to stand out of my class.
My thoughts are birds without wings. My imagination and actions let them fly.
My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.
My work is loving the world.
My world is about stories that entertain; emotions that move; people you'll remember; literature that matters.
Napoleon said of Massena, that he was not himself until the battle began to go against him; then, when the dead began to fall in ranks around him, awoke his powers of combination, and he put on terror and victory as a robe. So it is in rugged crises, in unweariable endurance, and in aims which put sympathy out of question, that the angel is shown.
Natives who beat drums to drive off evil spirits are objects of scorn to smart Americans who blow horns to break up traffic jams.
Natives who beat drums to drive off evil spirits are objects of scorn to smart people who blow horns to break up traffic jams.
Nat: Maybe you broke something.
Nature, by example, shows us anything worthwhile comes over time. Anything worthwhile grows methodically, building on a strong foundation. Develop a willingness to carry on despite roadblocks.
Nature gave men two ends... one to sit on and one to think with. Ever since then man's success or failure has been dependent on the one he used most.
Nature has a way of evening the odds.
Nature is pleased with simplicity. And nature is no dummy
Nature, it seems, is the popular name
Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.

Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself.
Never complain and never explain.
Never confuse motion with action.
Never continue in a job you don't enjoy. If you're happy in what you're doing, you'll like yourself, you'll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined.
Never cowardly or cruel. Never give up, never give in.
Never did a government commence under auspices so favorable, nor ever was success so complete.
Never does the human soul appear so strong and noble as when it forgoes revenge and dares to forgive injury.
Never do the impossible. People will expect you to do it forever after.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
Never explain -- your Friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway.
Never forget that there are only two philosophies to rule your life: the one of the cross, which starts with the fast and ends with the feast. The other of Satan, which starts with the feast and ends with the headache.
Never give in and never give up.
Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
Never give up, never give up, never, never, never give up!
Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
Never justify being rude; never forget to be kind.
Never keep up with the Joneses. Drag them down to your level. It's cheaper.
Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.
Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.
Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
Never let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or what you think could have beneficent social effects if it were believed; but look only and solely at what are the facts.
Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.
Never let your uniqueness be compromised
Never look down on anybody unless you're helping him up.
Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way.
Never mind what others do; do better than yourself, beat your own record from day to day, and you are a success.
Never, never, never give up.
Never preceed anything more complex than a Frisbee throw with, 'Hey boss, watch this!'
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today, and you make your tomorrow.
Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl.
Never say never
Never say no to now
Never say ""OOPS!"" always say ""Ah, Interesting!""
Never say that I have taken it, only that I have given it back.
Never talk defeat. Use words like hope, belief, faith, victory.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
Never test the depth of the water with both feet.
Never underestimate the power you have to take your life in a new direction.
Never violate the sacredness of your individual self-respect.
New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings.
New eyes have X-ray vision. [someone that hasn't written it is more likely to spot the bug. "someone" can be you after a break]
Nietzsche is a marvelous antidote to all fundamentally anti-Biblical efforts to turn mythology into a kind of Bible, and that is the project of the Jungians of this world, or to boil the Bible down to myth, and that is the project of more or less everyone else
NIHILIST, n. A Russian who denies the existence of anything but Tolstoi. The leader of the school is Tolstoi.
Nine out of the ten voices in my head say I'm not schizophrenic. The other one hums the melody of Tetris.
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many.
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
No amount of ability is of the slightest avail without honor.
No amount of exams will prepare you for life.
No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.
No art takes places without inspiration. Every artist also needs effective knowledge of his or her tools (e.g., does a certain brush function well with a particular kind of paint?). What's more, artists need effective techniques for using those tools.
No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Nobody can do for little children what grandparents do. Grandparents sort of sprinkle stardust over the lives of little children.
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.
Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent.
Nobody can tell what is right and what is wrong; what is righteous and what is evil. Even if there is a god and I had his teachings right before me, I would think it through and decide if that was right or wrong myself.
Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.
Nobody is good or bad. They are either strong or weak. Strong people stick to their morals, no matter what the trials and tribulations. Weak people, many a times, do not even realise how low they have fallen.
Nobody knows what you feel inside unless you tell them.
Nobody really cares if you're miserable, so you might as well be happy, and make the most of where you are
Nobody's perfect.
Nobody travels on the road to success without a puncture or two.
Nobody understands the nature of the Church, or the ringing note of the creed descending from antiquity, who does not realize that the whole world once very nearly died of broadmindedness and the brotherhood of all religions.
Nobody wants to believe that existence carries on without at least taking a stumble from their departure of this world.
No code of ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our condition.
No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.
No dirt can touch me, like an ocean, everything that comes to me becomes clean.
No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences, so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes.
No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris.
No foreign policy - no matter how ingenious - has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none.
No great man ever complains of want of opportunity.
No great thing is created suddenly.
No issue is so small that it can't be blown out of proportion.
No lake so still but it has its wave.
No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong is what is against it.
No living creature is naturally greedy, except from fear of want - or in the case of human beings, from vanity, the notion that you're better than people if you can display more superfluous property than they can.
No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.
No man ever achieved worth-while success who did not, at one time or other, find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure.
No man is crushed by misfortune unless he has first been deceived by prosperity
No man is more unhappy than he who never faces adversity. For he is not permitted to prove himself.
No man succeeds without a good woman behind him. Wife or mother, if it is both, he is twice blessed indeed.
No man was ever wise by chance
No man was ever yet a great poet, without at the same time being a profound philosopher.
No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist.
No matter how difficult and painful it may be, nothing sounds as good to the soul as the truth.
No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again.
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
No matter how many goals you have achieved, you must set your sights on a higher one.
No matter how much success you're having, you can't continue working together if you can't communicate.
No matter how much you plan, it is tenacity, unyielding desire to succeed, and the ability to cope with change that will eventually prevail.
No matter how much you plan you're likely to get half wrong anyway. So don't do the ‘paralysis through analysis' thing. That only slows progress and saps morale.
No matter how wide the road you walk it one foot at a time"
No matter how you care to define it, I do not identify with the local group. Planet, species, race, nation, state, religion, party, union, club, association, neighborhood improvement committee; I have no interest in any of it. I love and treasure individuals as I meet them, I loathe and despise the groups they identify with and belong to.
No matter how you feel, Get up, dress up, show up and never give up.
No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.
No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.
No more duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions.
None of the secrets of success will work unless you do.
Non est ad astra mollis e terris via" - "There is no easy way from the earth to the stars
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
'No one can make you successful; the will to success comes from within.' I've made this my motto. I've internalized it to the point of understanding that the success of my actions and/or endeavors doesn't depend on anyone else, and that includes a possible failure.
No one deserves love more than you.
No one else can want for me. No one can substitute his act of will for mine. It does sometimes happen that someone very much wants me to want what he wants. This is the moment when the impassable frontier between him and me, which is drawn by free will, becomes most obvious. I may not want that which he wants me to want - and in this precisely I am incommunicabilis. I am, and I must be, independent in my actions. All human relationships are posited on this fact.
No one has as much luck around the greens as one who practices a lot.
No one is all evil. Everybody has a good side. If you keep waiting, it will comme up.
No one is listening until you make a mistake.
No one is more cherished in this world than someone who lightens the burden of another.
No one is silly! Only childish!
No one's head aches when he is comforting another.
No one should ever ask themselves that: why am I unhappy? The question carries within it the virus that will destroy everything. If we ask that question, it means we want to find out what makes us happy. If what makes us happy is different from what we have now, then we must either change once and for all or stay as we are, feeling even more unhappy.
No one should have the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them.
No one succeeds without effort... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance.
No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude.
No passion is stronger in the breast of a man than the desire to make others believe as he believes. Nothing so cuts at the root of his happiness and fills him with rage as the sense that another rates low what he prizes high.
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.
No problem is so big that you can't run away from it.
No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude.
Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from.
Normal is over rated, and so is spelling.You want perfection? Go out and buy a spell check, but know this: Spellcheck won't keep you warm at night or love you unconditionaly. I will stick to being abnormal and a bad speller. Makes life more interesting. After all, what fun is there in being normal or perfect?
Normality is the route to nowhere.
No self-respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party who ignores her sex.
No single event can awaken within us a stranger whose existence we had never suspected. To live is to be slowly born.
No skill shapes a child's future success in school or in life more than the ability to read.
No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.
No society can prosper if it aims at making things easier-instead it should aim at making people stronger!!
No student ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him: it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required, that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction.
Not a good book. It attempts to take a complex subject and make it assessable to the layman with cartoons, and in this effort it fails. Moreover, the authors often take biased stances, and while I agree with them for the most part it nonetheless detracts from any scholarly offerings in which they wish to partake.
Not all doors open in the same direction and with the same effort!
Not all of Derrida's writing is to everyone's taste. He had an irritating habit of overusing the rhetorical question, which lends itself easily to parody: 'What is it, to speak? How can I even speak of this? Who is this "I" who speaks of speaking?
Not all restaurants have good food.
Not all who are silent do not want to talk.
Not bad, not bad at all," Diotallevi said. "To arrive at the truth through the painstaking reconstruction of a false text.
Note to self: Keep going. You're doing great. You might not be where you want to be yet, but that's okay. Just take it one step at a time and keep believing in yourself. And remember: No matter what happens, you can still enjoy your life and be happy.
Not every difficult and dangerous thing is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to success in achieving the object of our effort.
Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.
Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.

Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is just opinion.
Nothing exterior to me will ever take command of me.
Nothing good comes in life or athletics unless a lot of hard work has preceded the effort. Only temporary success is achieved by taking short cuts.
Nothing important is learned; it is simply remembered.
Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.
Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less.
Nothing in the cry of cicadas suggests they are about to die.
Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The phrase 'press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.
Nothing in the world is difficult if one sets her mind to it.
Nothing in the world is more common than unsuccessful people with talent.
Nothing in the world is permanent, and we're foolish when we ask anything to last, but surely we're still more foolish not to take delight in it while we have it. If change is of the essence of existence one would have thought it only sensible to make it the premise of our philosophy.
Nothing is as it seems, but something is everything it is made out to be.
Nothing is as seductive as the assurance of success.
Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.
Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely.

Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, "I'm possible!""
Nothing is impossible to him who will try.
Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity.

Nothing makes one feel so strong as a call for help.
Nothing recedes like success.
Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that something inside them was superior to circumstance.
Nothing succeeds like success.
Nothing succeeds like success. Get a little success, and then just get a little more.
Nothing succeeds like the appearance of success.
Nothing sweeter than to drag oneself along behind events; and nothing more reasonable. But without a strong dose of madness, no initiative, no enterprise, no gesture. Reason: the rust of our vitality. It is the madman in us who forces us to adventure; once he abandons us, we are lost; everything depends on him, even our vegetative life; it is he who invites us, who obliges us to breathe, and it is also he who forces our blood to venture through our veins. Once he withdraws, we are alone indeed! We cannot be normal and alive at the same time.
Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man's ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.
Nothing truly valuable arises from ambition or from a mere sense of duty; it stems rather from love and devotion towards men and towards objective things.
Nothing was ever in tune. People just blindly grabbed at whatever there was: communism, health foods, zen, surfing, ballet, hypnotism, group encounters, orgies, biking, herbs, Catholicism, weight-lifting, travel, withdrawal, vegetarianism, India, painting, writing, sculpting, composing, conducting, backpacking, yoga, copulating, gambling, drinking, hanging around, frozen yogurt, Beethoven, Back, Buddha, Christ, TM, H, carrot juice, suicide, handmade suits, jet travel, New York City, and then it all evaporated and fell apart. People had to find things to do while waiting to die. I guess it was nice to have a choice.
Nothing works better than just improving your product.
Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.
Not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystery.
Not only are there meaningless questions, but many of the problems with which the human intellect has tortured itself turn out to be only 'pseudo problems,' because they can be formulated only in terms of questions which are meaningless. Many of the traditional problems of philosophy, of religion, or of ethics, are of this character. Consider, for example, the problem of the freedom of the will. You maintain that you are free to take either the right- or the left-hand fork in the road. I defy you to set up a single objective criterion by which you can prove after you have made the turn that you might have made the other. The problem has no meaning in the sphere of objective activity; it only relates to my personal subjective feelings while making the decision.
Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our strongest impulse--the tyrant in us.
Not on one strand are all life's jewels strung.
No trees touch the sky.
No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.
Not telling is just as interesting as telling I have found. Why speech, that short verbal journey from inside to outside can be excrutiating under certain circumstances is fascinating.
Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents the Christians of today--burning us.
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
NOT to my contemporaries, not to my compatriots but to
Not to perpetrate cowardice against one's own acts! Not to leave them in the lurch afterward! The bite of conscience is indecent.
Nouvelle Cuisine, roughly translated, means: I can't believe I paid ninety-six pounds and I'm still hungry.
No winter lasts forever; no spring skips it's turn.
Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. I have read and heard many attempts at a systematic account of it, from materialism and theosophy to the Christian system or that of Kant, and I have always felt that they were much too simple. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy. That is the reason why I have no philosophy myself, and must be my excuse for dreaming.
No woman in maternity confinement can have stranger and more impatient wishes than I have.
Now that I've reached the top of the world, I can understand how God feels.
Now that science has helped us to overcome the awe of the unknown in nature, we are the slaves of social pressures of our own making. When called upon to act independently, we cry for patterns, systems, and authorities. If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate--in short, the emancipation from fear--then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render.
[N]ow we have a clearer idea what this story is all about: The world was made for man, and man was made to rule it.
Numbing the pain for a while will only make it worse when you finally feel it.

Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes.
Obedience brings success; exact obedience brings miracles.
Obedience is the mother of success and is wedded to safety.
Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.
Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea that could only have been invented in California.
Observe the movements of the stars as if you were running their courses with them, and let your mind constantly dwell on the changes of the elements into each other. Such imaginings wash away the filth of life on the ground.
Obsessed is a word that the lazy use to describe the dedicated.
Obstacles are necessary for success because in selling, as in all careers of importance, victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats.
Obstacles can't stop you. Problems can't stop you. Most of all, other people can't stop you. Only you can stop you.
O dear Pan and all the other gods of this place, grant that I may be beautiful inside. Let all my external possessions be in friendly harmony with what is within. May I consider the wise man rich. As for gold, let me have as much as a moderate man could bear and carry with him.
Of all human activities, man's listening to God is the supreme act of his reasoning and will.
Of all knowledge, the wise and good seek mostly to know themselves.
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.
Of all the radio stations in Chicago ... we're one of them.With every passing hour our solar system comes forty-three thousand miles closer to globular cluster 13 in the constellation Hercules, and still there are some misfits who continue to insist that there is no such thing as progress.
Of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal.
Of all the things people have taught me regarding life lessons or anything that would benefit me, I don't think anything helped me learn more about life than football. You go through so many different things: adversity, how to handle adversity, how to handle success, how to lead, how to be a teammate, how to communicate.
Of all things visible, the highest is the heaven of the fixed stars.
Of course life is uncertain and mysterious; that's what makes it so amazing.
'Of course,' said my grandfather, pulling a gun from his belt as he stepped from the Time Machine, 'There's no paradox if I shoot YOU'.
Of course, supernatural acts are what miracles are all about. They are, after all, precisely those things that circumvent the laws of nature. A god who can create the laws of nature can presumably also circumvent them at will. Although why they would have been circumvented so liberally thousands of years ago, before the invention of modern communication instruments that could have recorded them, and not today, is still something to wonder about.
Of course there is no formula for success, except perhaps an unconditional acceptance of life, and what it brings
Of course there's a risk that that could happen, but what is the alternative? To never allow myself to get close to anyone ever again? Never know the joy of loving someone for fear that it could end up in tears? My heart might stay safe, but it wouldn't be much of a life.
Of course, you may smoke - but please don't exhale.
Of Equality--as if it harm'd me, giving others the same chances and rights as myself--as if it were not indispensable to my own rights that others possess the same.
Often, these downplay the power of cultural imperialism - in that sense, playing the game of US interests - by reassuring us that the global success of American mass culture is not as bad as all that.
Of what use is a philosopher who doesn't hurt anybody's feelings?
Oh captain, my captain.
Oh, if only it were possible to find understanding," Joseph exclaimed. "If only there were a dogma to believe in. Everything is contradictory, everything tangential; there are no certainties anywhere. Everything can be interpreted one way and then again interpreted in the opposite sense. The whole of world history can be explained as development and progress and can also be seen as nothing but decadence and meaninglessness. Isn't there any truth? Is there no real and valid doctrine?"
Oh, I would love to be a motivational speaker. I have pulled myself out of a million potholes, and I can see the potholes ahead of me. That doesn't mean that I could always do that so perfectly for my own life. I totally fall in potholes.
Ohne Hast, aber ohne Rast. - Without haste, but without rest.
O how incomprehensible everything was, and actually sad, although it was also beautiful. One knew nothing. One lived and ran about the earth and rode through forests, and certain things looked so challenging and promising and nostalgic: a star in the evening, a blue harebell, a reed-green pond, the eye of a person or a cow. And sometimes it seemed that something never seen yet long desired was about to happen, that a veil would drop from it all, but then it passed, nothing happened, the riddle remained unsolved, the secret spell unbroken, and in the end one grew old and looked cunning . . . or wise . . . and still one knew nothing perhaps, was still waiting and listening.
Oh, why does compassion weaken us?'
Old age is like everything else. To make a success of it, you've got to start young.
Old people love to give good advice to console themselves for no longer being able to set a bad example.
Olivier took a deep breath, then turned and bowed in farewell. Gersonides nodded in return, then thought of something.
Omit needless words.
Omnia vincit amor" - "Love conquers all
On a grander scale, when a society segregates itself, the consequences affect the economy, the emotions, and the ecology. That's one reason why it's easy for pro-lifers to eat factory-raised animals that disrespect everything sacred about creation. And that is why it's easy for rabid environmentalists to hate chainsaws even though they snuggle into a mattress supported by a black walnut bedstead.
Once at a social gathering, Gladstone said to Disraeli, "I predict, Sir, that you will die either by hanging or of some vile disease". Disraeli replied, "That all depends, sir, upon whether I embrace your principles or your mistress."
Once I knew only darkness and stillness... my life was without past or future... but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living.
Once someone asked me, "What do you want to be your epitaph?" So I said, "Paulo Coelho died when he was alive.
Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.
Once upon a time there was a young prince who believed in all things but three. He did not believe in princesses, he did not believe in islands, he did not believe in God. His father, the king, told him that such things did not exist. As there were no princesses or islands in his father's domains, and no sign of God, the young prince believed his father.
Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.
Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent's pressure, and the temporary failures.
Once you choose hope, anything's possible.
Once you have a lot of success, you become a target in many ways.
One always has a choice.
One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become embarrassed.
One can ask why the I has to appear in the cogito {Descartes' argument "I think therefore I am.}, since the cogito, if used rightly, is the awareness of pure consciousness, not directed at any fact or action. In fact the I is not necessary here, since it is never united directly to consciousness. One can even imagine a pure and self-aware consciousness which thinks of itself as impersonal spontaneity.
One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.
One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.
One day, I got so disgusted that I sat down and wrote a list called 'Justin's list of things to do before he kicks the bucket.' I wrote it for myself and shortened it to 'Justin's Bucket List.' It was there on the wall, not as a story idea but as a motivational tool for myself, which actually ended up working pretty well.
One day in my shoes and a day for me in your shoes, the beauty of travel lies in the ease and willingness to be more open.
One day you will wake up and there won't be any more time to do the things you've always wanted. Do it now.
One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a forfeiture of the rights of man!
One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish a dictatorship.
One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one esteems equal or superior.
One does not have to be a philosopher to be a successful artist, but he does have to be an artist to be a successful philosopher. His nature is to view the world in an unpredictable albeit useful light.
One does what one is; one becomes what one does.
One fails forward toward success.
One finds limits by pushing them.
One forgives to the degree that one loves.
One goes through school, college, medical school and one's internship learning little or nothing about goodness but a good deal about success.
One great function of the arts is to keep ideals alive in a culture that does not yet realize them.
One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand that--kills with leniency.
One has to take a somewhat bold and dangerous line with this existence: especially as, whatever happens, we are bound to lose it.
One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation.
One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.
One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.
One is punished best for one's virtues.
One look is worth ten thousand words.
One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.
One man cannot practice many arts with success.
One man may hit the mark, another blunder; but heed not these distinctions. Only from the alliance of the one, working with and through the other, are great things born.
One man with courage makes a majority.
One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.
One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low.
One measure of your success will be the degree to which you build up others who work with you. While building up others, you will build up yourself.
One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work. But... I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.
One morning you wake up with more life behind you than in front of you, not being able to understand how it's happened.
One must reach out and try to grasp this astonishing finesse, that the value of lif cannot be estimated.
One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us good or ill?
One must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible. I'm alive and it's not my fault, which means I must somehow go on living the best I can, without bothering anybody, until I die.'
One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.
One needs more than ambition and talent to make a success of anything, really. There must be love and a vocation.
One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has communicated it.
One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never confess to the individual.
One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is "Don't try to be clever." And, "Listen to those quiet, nagging doubts." If you don't know, you don't know what you don't know, you don't know how much you don't know, and you don't know how much you needed to know.
One of my motivating forces has been to recreate the world I know into a world I wish I could be in. Hence my optimism and happy endings.
One of the greatest tragedies in life is to lose your own sense of self and accept the version of you that is expected by everyone else.
One of the hardest decision you'll ever face in life is choosing whether to walk away or try harder.
One of the key elements of human behavior is, humans have a greater fear of loss than enjoyment of success. All the academic studies will show you that the fear of loss of capital is far greater than the enjoyment of gains.
One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs.
One of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.
One of the professors told me last week that he feels bad teaching with the way the economy is now. 'What's the point?' he said. 'Kids aren't getting jobs.' You never hear faculty talk that way. He did.
One of the rewards of success is freedom, the ability to do whatever you like.
One of the sanest, surest, and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others.
One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesn't pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself.
One of the things that happens in the business is that success is a very strange thing in that if you are involved in something very successful the next person wants you to repeat it.
One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.
One picture puzzle piece
One rarely rushes into a single error. Rushing into the first one, one always does too much. So one usually perpetrates another one--and now one does too little.
One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.
One salutary development in recent ethical theorizing is the widespread recognition that no short argument will serve to eliminate any of the major metaethical positions. Such theories have to weave together views in semantics, epistemology, moral psychology and metaphysics. The comprehensive, holistic character of much recent theorizing suggests the futility of fastening on just a single sort of argument to refute a developed version of realism or antirealism. No one any longer thinks that ethical naturalism can be undermined in a single stroke by the open question argument, or that appeal to the descriptive semantics of moral discourse is sufficient to refute noncognitivism.
One says the things which one feels the need to say, and which the other will not understand: one speaks for oneself alone.
One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.
One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing it rather than in love with it.
One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, and compassion
One today is worth two tomorrows.
One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals.
One who asks a question is a fool for a minute; one who does not remains a fool forever.
One word can change your life forever.
[On Jason Mashak's book SALTY AS A LIP, as reviewed in The Prague Post:] Mashak amalgamates various national, historical and religious traditions into a myth-mash that illuminates many sects' fanatical compartmentalizing, and the fact that so many religions and philosophies share similar goals, if not roots.
Only after disaster can we be resurrected.
Only a life lived for others is worth living.
Only a philosopher's mind grows wings, since its memory always keeps it as close as possible to those realities by being close to which the gods are divine.
Only bad designers blame their failings on the users.
Only by examining our personal biases can we truly grow as artists; only by cultivating empathy can we truly grow as people.
Only by showing the world the cataclysmic cost of a world divided can it appreciate the wonders of life and endless possibilities of a world united.
Only God may be adored, because only God is unlimited goodness, truth, and beauty, and thus only God deserves unlimited love.
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Only in growth, reform, and change, paradoxically enough, is true security to be found.
...only in the surrender of the light could the darkness prevail.
Only make new mistakes.
Only newspaper editors and people with tapeworms should ever refer to themselves as, 'we'
Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. Some of them fall off, but others cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink. 'Ladies and Gentlemen,' they yell, 'we are floating in space!' But none of the people down there care
Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.
Only stupid people are changed by success.
Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.
Only the educated are free.
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment.
Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far it is possible to go.
Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I'm not so sure about the former.
On marriage: You sort of stumble along and reconnect and lose each other and reconnect again.
On ne peut penser et ecrire qu'assis [One cannot think and write except when seated] (G. Flaubert). There I have caught you, nihilist! The sedentary life is the very sin against the Holy Spirit. Only thoughts reached by walking have value.
On one hand the eternal attraction of man towards femininity (cf. Gn. 2:23) frees in him-or perhaps it should free-a gamut of spiritual-corporal desires of an especially personal and "sharing" nature (cf. analysis of the "beginning"), to which a proportionate pyramid of values corresponds. On the other hand, "lust" limits this gamut, obscuring the pyramid of values that marks the perennial attraction of male and female.
On one occasion a student burst into his office. "Professor Stigler, I don't believe I deserve this F you've given me." To which Stigler replied, "I agree, but unfortunately it is the lowest grade the University will allow me to award."
On the Bigotry of Culture:
On the one hand, all truth is relative; on the other hand, postmodernism tells it like it really is.
On the other hand, I have some fingers.
On the recollection of so many and great favours and blessings, I now, with a high sense of gratitude, presume to offer up my sincere thanks to the Almighty, the Creator and Preserver.
On the Samael Qlipha, the magician makes a pact with the dark forces and realizes the invitation of Friedrich Neitzsche to re-evaluate old values. Insanity becomes wisdom; death becomes life. Samael is the 'Poison of God.' Here is where illusions are poisoned, and all categories and conceptions are deconstructed until nothing is left. The dark side of the astral plane could be compared to a chalice filled with poison or an intoxicating fluid. While Gamaliel is the chalice, Samael is the elixir and the following lower Qlipha, A'arab Zaraq, is where the magician experiences the effect.
On the top of Cadair Idris,
On the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.
Open your heart - open it wide; someone is standing outside.
O philosophy, life's guide! O searcher-out of virtue and expeller of vices! What could we and every age of men have been without thee? Thou hast produced cities; thou hast called men scattered about into the social enjoyment of life.
Opinions alter, manners change, creeds rise and fall, but the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity.
Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work, so most people don't recognize them.
Opportunities don't happen, you create them.
Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door.
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
Optimism is the one quality more associated with success and happiness than any other.
Other people are only aspects of our own greater being.
Other people's success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation.
Others appreciate you more than you think.
Others see you as a wise person.
[O]ther thinkers have philosophised since the time of Plato, but that does not destroy the interest and beauty of his philosophy
Our ability to adapt is amazing. Our ability to change isn't quite as spectacular.
Our actions are guaranteed to affect others. Because we are not alone in this world, much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others. Our relationships are our teachers. We learn from each other.
Our ancestors have invented, we can at least innovate.
Our character...is an omen of our destiny, and the more integrity we have and keep, the simpler and nobler that destiny is likely to be.
Our culture has filled our heads but emptied our hearts, stuffed our wallets but starved our wonder. It has fed our thirst for facts but not for meaning or mystery. It produces "nice" people, not heroes.
Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success.
Our enemies are quite good for relentlessly keeping us sharp and on our toes. This especially goes for sincere philosophers. They use their enemies to challenge their arguments so that they can know the weak points in their own reasoning and how to argue for and strengthen their position. There are just none like one's enemies to always look for his mistakes and do it harder than anyone else.
"Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's neighbour":--so thinks every nation.
Our first and last love is self love.
Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.
Our greatest fear should not be of failure but of succeeding at things in life that don't really matter.
Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Our heritage and ideals, our code and standards - the things we live by and teach our children - are preserved or diminished by how freely we exchange ideas and feelings.
Our ideals are our better selves.
Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.
Our journey home will take a thousand lifetimes.
Our knowledge of circumstances has increased, but our uncertainty, instead of having diminished, has only increased. The reason of this is, that we do not gain all our experience at once, but by degrees; so our determinations continue to be assailed incessantly by fresh experience; and the mind, if we may use the expression, must always be under arms.
Our limitations and success will be based, most often, on your own expectations for ourselves. What the mind dwells upon, the body acts upon.
Our lives are part of a unique adventure... Nevertheless, most of us think the world is 'normal' and are constantly hunting for something abnormal--like angels or Martians. But that is just because we don't realize the world is a mystery. As for myself, I felt completely different. I saw the world as an amazing dream. I was hunting for some kind of explanation of how everything fit together.
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression. It is not conquest, it is not empire, it is not foreign bases, it is not domination. It is, simply put, just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam.
Our Similarities bring us to a common ground; Our Differences allow us to be fascinated by each other.
Our soul desires to be understanding, our ego is only concerned with being understood. When you are being understanding you are connected to your soul.
Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self; their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression.
Our success as a global brand has been directly related to how we select locations where we are confident our particular clients desire to be. Los Cabos, Mexico is the ideal Engel & Volkers market, growing in popularity among world luxury travelers seeking exceptional properties for second home opportunities.
Our success educationally, industrially and politically is based upon the protection of a nation founded by ourselves. And the nation can be nowhere else but in Africa.
Our success in Singapore was a Herculean effort by the whole team. Now I am determined to deliver on all we promised. I will be watching like a hawk.
Our time here is magic! It's the only space you have to realize whatever it is that is beautiful, whatever is true, whatever is great, whatever is potential, whatever is rare, whatever is unique, in. It's the only space.
Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been wounded.
Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is most difficult to us.--Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.
Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.
Our way to practice is one step at a time, one breath at a time.
Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give is to give those worldly things your best but never your all - reserve the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it.
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I will meet you there.
Out of difficulties grow miracles.
Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me, makes me stronger.
Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.
Outside of the killings, Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country
Overcoming fear is the first step to success for entrepreneurs. The winners all exemplify that, and the hard work and commitment they have shown underlines what is needed to set up a business.
Pactum serva" - "Keep the faith
Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.
Pain may be the only reality but if mankind had any sense it would pursue the delusion called happiness. All the philosophers and poets who tell us that pain and suffering have a place and purpose in the cosmic order of things are welcome to them. They are frauds. We justify pain because we do not know what to make of it, nor do we have any choice but to bear it. Happiness alone can make us momentarily larger than ourselves.
Pancakes were meant to be flipped!
Paranormalists, however, insist that our minds are transmitters that, with special effort, can focus like lasers to communicate across great distances, and even make things happen. That may seem far-fetched, but it's also a definition of prayer.
Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy.
Particularity leads to peculiarity and then to pathological behavior. The three Ps. It is very insidious. You would eventually end up in a box. If you try to control your environment, it will control you. And everyone else around you will always have to be making adjustments to your maddening idiosyncracies...You are beginning to enslave yourself with your fussiness.
Part of being a man is learning to take responsibility for your successes and for your failures. You can't go blaming others or being jealous. Seeing somebody else's success as your failure is a cancerous way to live.
Part of being of a true existentialist is wanting to be what we make ourselves be by the way we choose to act, as opposed to making excuses for the way we act and regretting it.
Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.
Passion is what gives meaning to our lives. It's what allows us to achieve success beyond our wildest imagination. Try to find a career path that you have a passion for.
Passively listening to gossip or negative talk is implied agreement.
Past success is no guarantee of future success, so I have learned to be an entrepreneur. I began to produce and direct my own projects.
Patience and tenacity of purpose are worth more than twice their weight of cleverness.
Patience is a remedy for every sorrow.
Patience is passion tamed.
Patience is the companion of wisdom.
Patience is the only way you can endure the gray periods.
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.
Patience - the gift of being able to see past the emotion.
Pay attention to me.
Pay attention to opportunity cost at all times. Doing one thing means not doing other things. This is a form of risk that is very easy to ignore, to your detriment.
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!
Peace at home, peace in the world.
Peace be to all people.
Peace does not mean the absence of war or the presence of abundance. It means the acceptance of tolerance, appreciation of diversity, forgiveness of ignorance, cultivation of kindness, and the presence of a joyful harmonious heart full of calmness.
Peace holds within itself trust in the Lord, the trust that He governs all things and provides all things, and that He leads towards an end that is good.
Peace is coming! Yeah! And so is the next money making conflict!
Peace is not something you wish for; It's something you make, Something you do, Something you are, And something you give away.
Peace is not so much a political mandate as it is a shared state of consciousness that remains elevated and intact only to the degree that those who value it volunteer their existence as living examples of the same... Peace ends with the unraveling of individual hope and the emergence of the will to worship violence as a healer of private and social dis-ease.
Peace on earth will come to stay, When we live Christmas every day.
People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.
People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal.
People are crazy and times are strange/ I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range/ I used to care, but things have changed.
People are, generally speaking, either dead certain or totally indifferent (Both types are crawling around deep down in the rabbit's fur!)
People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within.
People are the key to success or extraordinary success.
[People] ask themselves, what is suitable for my position? What is usually done by persons of my station and percuniary circumstances? Or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstances superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is customary in preference to what suits their own inclinations. It does not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary. Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds; they exercise choice only among things that are commonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until by dint of not following their own nature they have no nature to follow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own.
People do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.
People do not seem to realise that their opinion of the world is also a confession of their character.
People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; never throw out anyone.
People fall forward to success.
People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.
People grow when they are loved well. If you want to help others heal, love them without an agenda.
People have a way of becoming what you encourage them to be, not what you nag them to be.
People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does.
People need to realise what real happiness and success is, because success as an actor is fleeting. You can be up there one day and gone the next.
People of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success because they don't know when to quit. Most men succeed because they are determined to.
People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing.  That's why we recommend it daily.
People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily.
People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing--that's why we recommend it daily.
People ought to fight
People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing.
People repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals. The short-term reward loop acts over hours to years, and the long-term reproductive success loop over generations.
People say everybody has a book inside them, so why not make your life a great story?
People say we were an overnight success. It took us a year to be an overnight success.
People seldom do what they believe in. They do what is convenient, then repent.
People seldom see the halting and painful steps by which the most insignificant success is achieved.
People should decide on the books' meanings for themselves. They'll find a story that attacks such things as cruelty, oppression, intolerance, unkindness, narrow-mindedness, and celebrates love, kindness, open-mindedness, tolerance, curiosity, human intelligence.
People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else.
People talk about getting lucky breaks in their careers. I'm living proof that the 'lucky breaks' theory is simply wrong. You get to make your own luck.... The world is run by those who show up...not those who wait to be asked.
People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life.
People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don't realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.
People think that at the top there isn't much room. They tend to think of it as an Everest. My message is that there is tons of room at the top.
People think you're crazy if you talk about things they don't understand.
People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it's easy to be chewed up and spat out. You've got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.
People Who Are Crazy Enough To Think They Can Change The World, Are The Ones Who Do.
People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind.
People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.
People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
People who urge you to be realistic generally want you to accept their version of reality.
People will accept your ideas much more readily if you tell them Benjamin Franklin said it first.
People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
People will love you. People will hate you. And none of it will have anything to do with you.
People will not remember what you did for living,
Percayalah, bila kamu tidak dapat mengalihkan perhatian pada hal lain yang fana..., dan hanya memikirkan kehidupan itu sendiri, kamu akan gila: karena ia akan mengalahkan dan merendahkanmu secara perlahan.
Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning.
Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.
Perfection is something we should all strive for. It's a duty and a joy to perfect one's nature... The most difficult thing is love. A loveless, driving person that just competes in the rat race is far from perfection in my book.
Perfection- one's misguided perception of reality
Performance-wise, you really need to be down in the trenches; you need to do the hard work, for a lot of reasons: To build yourself as a performer, to get a sense of the audience, to work hard and to wonder, 'Do I really want to do this?'
Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.
Perhaps in his loneliness he had acquired the silent conviction that he was 'the last', the one, the only. And, being the last, he ceased to be Benjamin, becoming Israel. And upon his heart had settled the history of five thousand years, no longer remote, but become as the history of his own lifetime. His "I" was the converse of the imperial "We.
Perhaps not one religion contains all of the truth of the world. Perhaps every religion contains fragments of the truth, and it is our responsibility to identify those fragments and piece them together.
Perhaps our eyes need to be washed by our tears once in a while, so that we can see Life with a clearer view again.
Perhaps struggle is all we have because the god of history is an atheist, and nothing about his world is meant to be. So you must wake up every morning knowing that no promise is unbreakable, least of all the promises of waking up at all. This is not despair. These are the preferences of universe itself: verbs over nouns, actions over states, struggle over hope.
Perhaps swimming was dancing under the water, he thought. To swim under lily pads seeing their green slender stalks wavering as you passed, to swim under upraised logs past schools of sunfish and bluegills, to swim through reed beds past wriggling water snakes and miniature turtles, to swim in small lakes, big lakes, Lake Michigan, to swim in small farm ponds, creeks, rivers, giant rivers where one was swept along easefully by the current, to swim naked alone at night when you were nineteen and so alone you felt like you were choking every waking moment, having left home for reasons more hormonal than rational; reasons having to do with the abstraction of the future and one's questionable place in the world of the future, an absurdity not the less harsh for being so widespread.
Perhaps the most delightful friendships are those in which there is much agreement, much disputation, and yet more personal liking.
Perhaps the most important thing we can undertake toward the reduction of fear is to make it easier for people to accept themselves, to like themselves.
Perhaps what I am about to say will appear strange to you gentlemen, socialists, progressives, humanitarians as you are, but I never worry about my neighbor, I never try to protect society which does not protect me -- indeed, I might add, which generally takes no heed of me except to do me harm -- and, since I hold them low in my esteem and remain neutral towards them, I believe that society and my neighbor are in my debt.
Perhaps what is inexpressible (what I find mysterious and am not able to express) is the background against which whatever I could express has its meaning.
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.
Perseverance - a lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success.
Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody.
Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.
Perseverance is more prevailing than violence; and many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken little by little.
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.
Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.
Perseverance, secret of all triumphs.
Personally, I can't see the appeal in trekking down to D.C. for a networking extravaganza, even if it is built around a special moment in American history. While I find the election of Barack Obama inspirational, I don't have a desire to memorialize it with overly effusive celebration.
Personally, I prefer Stevie Wonder," confessed the Chink, "but what the hell. Those cowgirls are always bitching because the only radio station in the area plays nothing but polkas, but I say you can dance to
Personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement, all success, all achievement in real life grows.
Personal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success.
Personifiers of the world! Unite! You have nothing to lose but Mr. Dignity!
Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.
Philosophers are people who know less and less about more and more, until they know nothing about everything. Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.
Philosophers can debate the meaning of life, but you need a Lord who can declare the meaning of life.
Philosophers console themselves with explanations.
Philosophers, for example, often fail to recognize that their remarks about the universe apply also to themselves and their remarks. If the universe is meaningless, so is the statement that it is so.
Philosophers have often held dispute
Philosophers' Syndrome: mistaking a failure of the imagination for an insight into necessity.
Philosophizing is simply one way of being afraid, a cowardly pretense that doesn't get you anywhere.
Philosophy
Philosophy and science have not always been friendly toward the idea of God, the reason being they are dedicated to the task of accounting for things and are impatient with anything that refuses to give an account of itself. The philosopher and the scientist will admit that there is much that they do not know; but that is quite another thing from admitting there is something which they can never know, which indeed they have no technique for discovering.
Philosophy and the study of the real world have the same relation to one another as onanism and sexual love.
Philosophy, as we use the word, is a fight against the fascination which forms of expression exert upon us.
Philosophy begins in wonder. And at the end when philosophic thought has done its best the wonder remains.
Philosophy can make people sick.
Philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith, but should understand itself and know just what it has indeed to offer, without taking anything away, least of all cheating people out of something by making them think it is nothing.
Philosophy cannot be extinguished, though men will try ... The spirit seeks the light, that is its nature. It wishes to return to its origin, and must forever try to reach enlightenment.
Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth.
Philosophy . . .consists chiefly in suggesting unintelligible answers to insoluble problems.
Philosophy does not claim to secure for us anything outside our control. Otherwise it would be taking on matters that do not concern it. For as wood is the material of the carpenter, and marble that of the sculptor, so the subject matter of the art of life is the life of the self.
Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.
philosophy don't differ from science.
Philosophy, from the earliest times, has made greater claims, and achieved fewer results, than any other branch of learning.
Philosophy is an amazing tissue of really fine thinking and incredible, puerile mistakes. It's like one of those rubber 'bones' they give dogs to chew, damned good for the mind's teeth, but as food - no bloody good at all.
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.
Philosophy is common sense with big words.
Philosophy is like trying to open a safe with a combination lock: each little adjustment of the dials seems to achieve nothing, only when everything is in place does the door open.
Philosophy is like wine. There are good years and bad years but, in general, the older the better.
Philosophy is not a spectator sport.
Philosophy is one reason which could lead to death.
Philosophy is really nostalgia, the desire to be at home.
Philosophy is the critically reflective, systematically articulated attempt to illumine our human experience in depth and set it in a vision of the whole.
Philosophy is the highest music.
Philosophy is the toil which can never tire persons engaged in it. All ways are strewn with roses, and the farther you go, the more enchanting objects appear before you and invite you on.
Philosophy ought to question the basic assumptions of the age. Thinking through, critically and carefully, what most of us take for granted is, I believe, the chief task of philosophy, and the task that makes philosophy a worthwhile activity.
Philosophy: the finding of bad reasons for what one believes by instinct.
Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possiblities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what the may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familar things in an unfamilar aspect
Philosophy when superficially studied, excites doubt, when thoroughly explored, it dispels it.
Philosophy, which once seemed outmoded, remains alive because the moment of its realization was missed. The summary judgement that it had merely interpreted the world is itself crippled by resignation before reality, and becomes a defeatism of reason after the transformation of the world failed. It guarantees no place from which theory as such could be concretely convicted of the anachronism, which then as now it is suspected of. Perhaps the interpretation which promised the transition did not suffice. The moment on which the critique of theory depended is not to be prolonged theoretically. Praxis, delayed for the foreseeable future, is no longer the court of appeals against self-satisfied speculation, but for the most part the pretext under which executives strangulate that critical thought as idle which a transforming praxis most needs. After philosophy broke with the promise that it would be one with reality or at least struck just before the hour of its production, it has been compelled to ruthlessly criticize itself.
Philosophy without action is the ruin of the soul. One brave deed is worth a hundred books, a thousand theories, a million words. Now as always we need heroes. And heroines! Down with the passive and the limp.
Photography is painting with light.
Physical bravery is an animal instinct; moral bravery is much higher and truer courage.
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is.
Piety, then, is that which is dear to the gods, and impiety is that which is not dear to them.
Pink is as sensual as the rays of the setting sun.
Pink is it!
Pink satisfies my hunger as no other color could.
Pink says it with a passion.
Pink's heart is full of color.
PI seconds is a nanocentury.
Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like tender hands on a Cyclops.
Pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion.
Plant thy foot firmly in the prints which His foot has made before thee.
Plant your garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.
Plato offers the amazing idea that contemplation of the way things really are is, in itself, a purifying process that can bring human beings into the only divinity there is.
Plato was a bore.
Playing God is actually the highest expression of human nature. The urges to improve ourselves, to master our environment, and to set our children on the best path possible have been the fundamental driving forces of all of human history. Without these urges to 'play God', the world as we know it wouldn't exist today.
Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'
Play with a cactus and you will get pricked!
Please, no matter how we advance technologically, please don't abandon the book. There is nothing in our material world more beautiful than the book.
Please pay attention very carefully, because this is the truest thing a stranger will ever say to you: In the face of such hopelessness as our eventual, unavoidable death, there is little sense in not at least TRYING to accomplish all your wildest dreams in life.
Pleasure can be supported by an illusion; but happiness rests upon truth.
Plus d'un qui n'a pu liberer ses propres chaines a su pourtant en liberer son ami.
Poetry and art nourish the soul of the world with the flavor-filled substances of beauty, wisdom and truth.
Poetry excites innate emotions and perceptions that let you create a new world where you have never visited and no one else can enter.
Poetry is the essence of life in which twinkling lights tickle the minds of readers and take them to a world where no one else can enter.
Poetry is when emotion blooms like flowers with the petals of words and spreads the fragrance of perception.
Poetry magically excites an unknown mysterious emotion.
Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.
Police officers and firemen are so visible in their daily work, there's no mistaking they're there - and that presence makes people feel secure.
Political language. . . is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.
Politicians will always send others off to fight their wars.
Popular medicine and popular morality belong together and ought not to be evaluated so differently as they still are: both are the most dangerous pseudo-sciences.
Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
Positive thinking is the key to success in business, education, pro football, anything that you can mention. I go out there thinking that I'm going to complete every pass.
Possessed with a full confidence of the certain success which British valor must gain over such enemies, I have led you up these steep and dangerous rocks, only solicitous to show you the foe within your reach.
Possibility, infinity, beauty -- none of those words were right. [...] What he really wanted to say was: have you felt this? this phantom life streaking like a phosphorescent hound at the edges of your ruin?
Posthumous men--I, for example--are understood worse than timely ones, but heard better. More precisely: we are never understood--hence our authority.
Post-operatively the transplanted kidney functioned immediately with a dramatic improvement in the patient's renal and cardiopulmonary status. This spectacular success was a clear demonstration that organ transplantation could be life-saving.

Pour on, I will endure.
Poverty is a virtue which one can teach oneself.
Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life.
Power means happiness; power means hard work and sacrifice.
Practice makes perfeckt.
Pragmatism asks its usual question. "Grant an idea or belief to be true," it says, "what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? How will the truth be realized? What experiences will be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?
Praise can be your most valuable asset as long as you don't aim it at yourself.
Pray as though everything depended on God. Work as though everything depended on you.
Prayer is based on the remote possibility that someone is actually listening; but so is a lot of conversation. If the former seems far-fetched, consider the latter: even if someone is listening to your story, and really hearing, that person will disappear from existence in the blink of a cosmic eye, so why bother to tell this perhaps illusory and possibly un-listening person something he or she is unlikely to truly understand, just before the two of you blip back out of existence? We like to talk to people who answer us, intelligently if possible, but we do talk without needing response or expecting comprehension. Sometimes, the event is the word, the act of speaking. Once we pull that apart a bit, the action of talking becomes more important than the question of whether the talking is working-because we know, going in, that the talking is not working. That said, one might as well pray.
Prayer is man's greatest power!
Praying five times a day does not make a person religious, helping five people does. Saying grace before meal does not make a person religious, helping another person acquire meal does.
Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it.
Premature abstraction is an equally grievous sin as premature optimization.
Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.
President Obama called for a 'we' nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes. It is not just inspirational. It is aspirational. It pricks the walls of our compartmentalized minds, opens our hearts and makes us brave. And that's what we need most in our country today.
Press forward. Do not stop, do not linger in your journey, but strive for the mark set before you.
Pretend you are foolish to the foolish, and be yourself when you are alone or with others like you, because if you take the foolish seriously as your friend, you might be a fool yourself.
Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and, like all of man's values, it has to be earned.
Pride is what we have.  Vanity is what others have.
Pride makes us artificial; humility makes us real
Probably I am very naive, but I also think I prefer to remain so, at least for the time being and perhaps for the rest of my life.
Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
Problems are the price of progress.
Problems in science are sometimes made easier by adding complications.
Problems or successes, they all are the results of our own actions. Karma. The philosophy of action is that no one else is the giver of peace or happiness. One's own karma, one's own actions are responsible to come to bring either happiness or success or whatever.
Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way.
Processors don't get better so that they can have more free time. Processors get better so _you_ can have more free time.
Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy.
Procrastination is the thief of time.
Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots. So far the Universe is winning.
Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.
Programming is the art of figuring out what you want so precisely that even a machine can do it.
Progress has always been achieved by probing well-entrenched and well-founded forms of life with unpopular and unfounded values. This is how man gradually freed himself from fear and from the tyranny of unexamined systems.
Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code.
Projects promoting programming in "natural language" are intrinsically doomed to fail.
Propounding peace and love without practical or institutional engagement is delusion, not virtue.
Prospering just doesn't have to do with money.
Psychiatric institutions are full of good intentions.
Puddings were just made for sauce.
Pure anecdotal statements would not convince others about the actual societal problems and solutions without providing reliable empirical evidence.
Pure love is a willingness to give without a thought of receiving anything in return.
Purpose and laughter are the twins that must not separate. Each is empty without the other.
Pursue not the outer entanglements; Dwell not in the inner void; Be serene in the oneness of things; And dualism vanishes by itself.
Pursue one great decisive aim with force and determination.
Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.
Putting food under lock and key was one of the great innovations of your culture. No other culture in history has ever put food under lock and key - and putting it there is the cornerstone of your economy.[...] Because if the food wasn't under lock and key, Julie, who would work?

Put your future in good hands - your own.
Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Quality is much better than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.

Racism exists in the mind, not the heart.
Rainbow your day!
Rainer Maria Rilke greeted and wrestled with the angels of his Duino Elegies in the solitude of a castle surrounded by white cliffs tall trees and the sea. I greeted most of mine in the solitude of a house that still vibrated with the throbs of a singular life that had helped shape many lives and with the ache of attempts to render useful service to that life. The River of Winged Dreams was therefore constructed as a link between dimensions of past and future emotions and intellect and matter and spirit.

Raising children is an uncertain thing; success is reached only after a life of battle and worry.
Rap music's been around for too long now to be inspirational. The words are, but the music isn't.
Rarely do great beauty and great virtue dwell together as they do in you.
Rationalism is false not because it seeks to express reality in rational mode, so far as this possible, but because it seeks to embrace the whole of reality in the realm of reason, as if the reason coincides with the very principle of things.
Reach for it. Push yourself as far as you can.
Reach for the stars.
Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.
Reading was very important to me as a kid. It was very inspirational to me. I went to a school where that wasn't encouraged so much, but my parents encouraged that, and it has made me part of who I am.
Real difficulties can be overcome; it is only the imaginary ones that are unconquerable.
...reality is always plural and mutable.
Reality is harsh. It can be cruel and ugly. Yet no matter how much we grieve over our environment and circumstances nothing will change. What is important is not to be defeated, to forge ahead bravely. If we do this, a path will open before us.
Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.
Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness.
Really, nobody was there?" I asked.
Real success is being totally indulgent about your own trip. You put your blinders on about the garbage and go full speed ahead.
Real success is finding you lifework in the work that you love.
Real success is not, like, materialistic. It's being where you want to be when you want to be; just living your life how you feel; having an ultimate goal and being able to accomplish it.
Real success is not on the stage, but off the stage as a human being, and how you get along with your fellow man.

Refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance, career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology. Sometimes it's good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide.
Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite. And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive.
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
Rejoice in the things that are present; all else is beyond thee.

Religion is beyond the realm of logic, but if any priest, pundit or maulvi tries to justify his religion with logic, it sounds absurd and illogical.
Religions are many and diverse, but reason and goodness are one.
religion, the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit of Puritanism.
Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers.
Remember, always be yourself ... unless you suck!
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.
Remember no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.
Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more.
Remember that we will not be here forever. Good thoughts, good ideas, and good deeds have a chance to live for a very long time.
Remember that you are humans in the first place and only after that programmers.
Remember, there are no mistakes, only lessons. Love yourself, trust your choices, and everything is possible.
Remember there's no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple with no logical end.
Remember the things in life that are free to each of us-our family, our friends, our soul, our hopes, our dreams, and our knowledge-are the most important.
Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium. When the food or drink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it passes you by don't try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you yet, don't let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife, wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on offer and you will have a share in the gods' power as well as their company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus and philosophers like them came to be called, and considered, divine.
Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
Remember you will not always win. Some days, the most resourceful individual will taste defeat. But there is, in this case, always tomorrow - after you have done your best to achieve success today.
Resources are hired to give results, not reasons.

Rudeness instantly establishes a set of norms, a set of regulatory orders, authority, and power. To be rude is to go against an established accepted concept or ordered regulation. Thus rudeness could be in kind, a deviation from the norm. Rudeness can also be in kind an instantiation outside a set foundation. A deviation from a norm holds the same set foundation as the norm, their disagreement merely a manner of degrees.

Saint Thomas Aquinas says, wisely, that the only way to drive out a bad passion is by a stronger good passion. The same is true of thoughts as of passions. When your mind wanders, like a child, your will must bring it back, like a mother. [. . .] The will-parent must discipline the mind-child, avoiding both the opposite extremes commonly made in disciplining either children or thoughts: tyranny or permissiveness.
Sanity calms, but madness is more interesting.
Sanity is not about confrontation. It's about filtering. Having a stable and happy life is about saying "no" to crazy people, not about inviting them in and then hoping that confrontations are going to make them sane.

Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders.
Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.
Science must not impose any philosophy, any more than the telephone must tell us what to say.
SCREW CHILDREN!
Security is both the biggest issue in bitcoin and the biggest opportunity in bitcoin. Solve it and you may create a massive new industry.
Security Is Mostly A Superstition. Life Is Either A Daring Adventure Or Nothing.
Security is not the meaning of my life. Great opportunities are worth the risk.
Sed nescio quo modo nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosphorum. (There is nothing so absurd but some philosopher has said it.)
Seduced by the spectacular theoretical and practical successes of the objective sciences into thinking that the methods and criteria of those sciences were the only means to truth, philosophers sought to apply those same methods and criteria to questions relating to the meaning of life and the values that give meaning to life. Philosophy, especially the Analytical species prevalent in the English-speaking world, was broken up into specialized disciplines and fragmented into particular problems, all swayed and impregnated by scientism, reductionism, and relativism. All questions of meaning and value were consigned to the rubbish heap of 'metaphysical nonsense'.
Seeing is not always believing, its the other way around. Believe and you will see.
See the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist clings to facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in particular cases, and generalises. Truth, for him, becomes a class-name for all sorts of definite working-values in experience. For the rationalist it remains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which we must defer. When the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just why we must defer, the rationalist is unable to recognise the concretes from which his own abstraction is taken. He accuses us of denying truth; whereas we have only sought to trace exactly why people follow it and always ought to follow it. Your typical ultra-abstractions fairly shudders at concreteness: other things equal, he positively prefers the pale and spectral. If the two universes were offered, he would always choose the skinny outline rather than the rich thicket of reality. It is so much purer, clearer, nobler.
See the moon? It hates us.
See the world for what it is.
Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think...
Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here.
Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success.
Self-centeredness is the basis for all sorts of immoral behavior as well as all the sorrows of humanity.
Self-discipline is a form of freedom. Freedom from laziness and lethargy, freedom from expectations and demands of others, freedom from weakness and fear -- and doubt.
Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control: These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
Sense shines with a double luster when it is set in humility. An able and yet humble man is a jewel worth a kingdom.
Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its root remains weak, and is easily torn up.
Septimus has been working too hard" - that was all she could say to her own mother. To love makes one solitary, she thought.
Serenity comes when you trade expectations for acceptance.
Serious thinkers are few, and the world is ruled by crude ideas.
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.
Set a goal to achieve something that is so big, so exhilarating that it excites you and scares you at the same time.
Set out each day believing in your dreams. Know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
Settle, for sure and universally, what conduct will promote the happiness of a rational being.
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there.
Set yourself earnestly to see what you are made to do, and then set yourself earnestly to do it.
Set your sights high, the higher the better. Expect the most wonderful things to happen, not in the future but right now. Realize that nothing is too good. Allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way.
Seventy percent of success in life is showing up.
Several people have told me that my inability to suffer fools gladly is one of my main weaknesses.
Sex is never the same when you're with another person.
Shaken, not stirred.
Shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings.
Share your idea and watch them grow.
Share your love, share you happiness, care for others; your wealth will be endless.
She had lost herself in this old work, her personality dissolving into it, so that she had been set free. The immortality of the soul lies in its dissolution; this was the cryptic comment that so frustrated Olivier and which Julien had only ever grasped as evidence for the history of a particular school of thought. He had known all about its history, but Julia knew what it meant. He found the realization strangely reassuring.
She has lived under the covers of selfless love, and so was imbibed by her.
She said, "It's not life or death, the labyrinth."
She said, "You're a warrior. So how do you kill without rage?"
She smiled. She knew she was dying. But it did not matter any longer. She had known something which no human words could ever tell and she knew it now. She had been awaiting it and she felt it, as if it had been, as if she had lived it. Life had been, if only because she had known it could be, and she felt it now as a hymn without sound, deep under the little whole that dripped red drops into the snow, deeper than that from which the red drops came. A moment or an eternity- did it matter? Life, undefeated, existed and could exist. She smiled, her last smile, to so much that had been possible.
Shoot for the moon and if you miss you will still be among the stars.
Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.
Should I have a doughnut or my disgusting cardboard?" asked Gwynn, as she drew up languidly before me at a study table in a bookstore on State Street, raising a puffed rice cake in the air.
Show, don't tell.
Show me that I m everywhere and get me home for tea.
Show me the money!
Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love?
Side projects are less masturbatory than reading RSS, often more useful than MobileMe, more educational than the comments on Reddit, and usually more fun than listening to keynotes.
Silence is a source of great strength.
Silence is a virtue.
Silence is silly after you have spoken in anger.
Silence is the last thing the world will ever hear from me.
Silent pictures show us how we lived and what our attitudes were. And as an art form, they can be wonderfully entertaining and often inspirational.
Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple, stupid behavior.
Simple things should be simple. Complex things should be possible.
Simplicity and pragmatism beat complexity and theory any day.
Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means.
Simplicity, patience, compassion.
Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.
Sina jinsi. Nguzo ya maisha yangu ni historia ya maisha yangu. Historia ya maisha yangu ni urithi wa watu waliojifunza kusema hapana kwa ndiyo nyingi -- waliojitolea vitu vingi katika maisha yao kunifikisha hapa nilipo leo -- walionifundisha falsafa ya kushindwa si hiari. Siri ya mafanikio yangu ni kujitahidi kwa kadiri ya uwezo wangu wote; au 'pushing the envelope' kwa lugha ya kigeni.
Since God is truth, a contempt for truth is equally a contempt for God.
Since we launched the original 'Pop Idol' in England, I've remained close with Simon Fuller. Working as executive producer on 'American idol' for its first seven years not only was an inspirational journey into the heart of American pop culture, it opened my eyes to the untapped potential of the incredibly dynamic young people in this world.
Since we nowadays think that all a man needs for acquisition of truth is to exert his brain more or less vigorously, and since we consider an
Singleness of purpose is one of the chief essentials for success in life, no matter what may be one's aim.
Sing to the tune of "The Teddy Bears Picnic"
Sin is a gravitation.
Sink not into oblivion, but sink into a nice hot spa.
Sin sorpresas, aunque sean disagredables, nadie estaria dispuesto a vivir.
Sit still with me in the shade of these green trees, which have no weightier thought than the withering of their leaves when autumn arrives, or the stretching of their many stiff fingers into the cold sky of the passing winter. Sit still with me and meditate on how useless effort is, how alien the will, and on how our very meditation is no more useful than effort, and no more our own than the will. Meditate too on how a life that wants nothing can have no weight in the flux of things, but a life the wants everything can likewise have no weight in the flux of things, since it cannot obtain everything, and to obtain less than everything is not worthy of souls that seek the truth.
Sitting still is a pain in the ass.
Sitting there on the heather, on our planetary grain, I shrank from the abysses that opened up on every side, and in the future. The silent darkness, the featureless unknown, were more dread than all the terrors that imagination had mustered. Peering, the mind could see nothing sure, nothing in all human experience to be grasped as certain, except uncertainty itself; nothing but obscurity gendered by a thick haze of theories. Man's science was a mere mist of numbers; his philosophy but a fog of words. His very perception of this rocky grain and all its wonders was but a shifting and a lying apparition. Even oneself, that seeming-central fact, was a mere phantom, so deceptive, that the most honest of men must question his own honesty, so insubstantial that he must even doubt his very existence.
Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism--and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency.
Skepticism is thus a resting-place for human reason, where it can reflect upon its dogmatic wanderings and make survey of the region in which it finds itself, so that for the future it may be able to choose its path with more certainty. But it is no dwelling-place for permanent settlement. Such can be obtained only through perfect certainty in our knowledge, alike of the objects themselves and of the limits within which all our knowledge of objects is enclosed.
Skills are cheap. Passion is priceless.
Slice a pear and you will find that its flesh is incandescent white. It glows with inner light. Those who carry a knife and a pear are never afraid of the dark.
Slowly we became silent, and silence itself if an enemy to friendship.
Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.
Smartass Disciple: Master, do you really believe in the second chance?
Smash forehead on keyboard to continue.
Smile, it makes people wonder what you're thinking.
Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors.
Snow floated down every once in a while, but it was frail snow, like a memory fading into the distance.
Socialism has no moral justification whatsoever; poor people are not morally superior to rich people, nor are they owed anything by rich people simply because of their lack of success. Charity is not a socialist concept - it is a religious one, an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over property, a sovereignty the Left utterly rejects.
Society breeds convention.
Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.
Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression...
Society is joint action and cooperation in which each participant sees the other partner's success as a means for the attainment of his own.
So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him! Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason many think him red-hot.
Socrates: Have you noticed on our journey how often the citizens of this new land remind each other it is a free country?
Socrates himself said, 'One thing only I know, and this is that I know nothing.'
Socrates should have written comics.
Socrates: This man, on one hand, believes that he knows something, while not knowing [anything]. On the other hand, I -- equally ignorant -- do not believe [that I know anything].
Software is like sex: It's better when it's free.
So he came to realize that learning a language was perhaps the most profound thing a man could do. Not only did it require wrapping different sounds around the very movement of your soul, it involved learning things somehow already known, as though much of what he was somehow existed apart from him. A kind of enlightenment accompanied these first lessons, a deeper understanding of self.
So I feel like success is opportunity plus preparation, so work begets work, and as long as you're prepared it's going to continue to come your way.
So it follows that those who have reason have freedom to will or not to will, although this freedom is not equal in all of them. [...] human souls are more free when they persevere in the contemplation of the mind of God, less free when they descend to the corporeal, and even less free when they are entirely imprisoned in earthly flesh and blood.
So I wanted to sing inspirational music, and that's exactly how I approached it - only the words have been changed to declare my relationship with God.
So, let me get this straight-- You want me to stop being a lesbian and being attracted to women because it is a 'sin'? Last time I checked, when you lie you are sinning. Sure, I could tell you I am no longer a lesbian or that I am no longer attracted to women and am straight, or I could even tell you the moon is made of cheese. I could tell you many things, but the moon will still not be made of cheese, and I will still not be attracted to men. I could tell you a lie in order to placate you, but isn't the truth supposed to set me free? I choose truth over lies any day of the week.
So long as thou feelest the stars as an "above thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.

Some concepts are so incredibly risky they take an honest fool to try to articulate them.
Some couples were just meant to be together.
Someday is not a day of the week.
Some day people will ask me what is the key to my success...and I will simply say, "good Karma.
Some days you are the fly, other days you are the windscreen.
Someday you will write a book.
Some drink at the fountain of knowledge...others just gargle.
Somehow I can't believe that there are any heights that can't be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true. This special secret, it seems to me, can be summarized in four C s. They are curiosity, confidence, courage, and constancy.
Some may say Ruby is a bad rip-off of Lisp or Smalltalk, and I admit that. But it is nicer to ordinary people.
Some mornings, it's just not worth chewing through the leather straps.

Some of the world's greatest feats were accomplished by people not smart enough to know they were impossible.

Someone with their feet planted firmly on the ground has no hope of reaching the stars.
Some people dream of success, while other people get up every morning and make it happen.
Some people grumble because roses have thorns; I am thankful that the thorns have roses.
Some people insist that 'mediocre' is better than 'best.' They delight in clipping wings because they themselves can't fly. They despise brains because they have none.
Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep
Some say I'm an overnight success. Well, that was a very long night that lasted about 10 years.
Sometimes all the players get a bad hand. You just have to be determined enough to see the game through.
Sometimes I lie awake at night and I ask, "Is life a multiple choice test or is it a true or false test?" ...Then a voice comes to me out of the dark and says, "We hate to tell you this but life is a thousand word essay.
Sometimes I lie awake at night, and I ask, "Where have I gone wrong?" Then a voice says to me, "This is going to take more than one night."
Sometimes I'm too frightened to be myself.
Sometimes, in a summer morning,
Sometimes in life the path gets narrow even as the road get wide and one still gets lost
Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not. In either case the idea is quite staggering.
Sometimes I worry about being a success in a mediocre world.
Sometimes life is like two lost people giving each other directions"
Sometimes not telling people anything is a good thing.
Sometimes people are abundant not in their actions but who they truly are.
Sometimes... Reason and Love are met with a violent ignorance that even what's right gets lost. Our heart bleeds, but when does the blood shed end and the healing begin?
Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.
Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.
Sometimes the only way to succeed is to fail backwards
Sometimes the sound of silence is the most deafening sound of all.
Sometimes to stand out you need to sit down.
Sometimes we may ask God for success, and He gives us physical and mental stamina. We might plead for prosperity, and we receive enlarged perspective and increased patience, or we petition for growth and are blessed with the gift of grace. He may bestow upon us conviction and confidence as we strive to achieve worthy goals.
Sometimes when I have a mountain of paperwork, I dream of how many paper planes I can make.
Sometimes when I wake up I feel like that I don't really know the person next to me.
Sometimes when learning comes before experience it doesn't make sense right away.
Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.
Sometimes with the most intense pain a paralysis of sensibility occurs. The soul disintegrates--hence the deadly frost--the free power of the mind--the shattering, ceaseless wit of this kind of despair. There is no inclination for anything any more--the person is alone, like a baleful power--as he has no connection with the rest of the world he consumes himself gradually--and in accordance with his own principle he is--misanthropic and misotheos.
Sometimes you don't realize how special something is until you lose it. Thats how I feel about Ramadan every year.
Sometimes you need to push people into the deep for some people will never learn to swim if they've never been taught how it feels to drown.
Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.
Some want to live within the sound
Some way some how i'm going to be happy i'm going to laugh i'm going to prosper,i feel good that i remain positive thru these mess up times!!!
Some we proudly display on our arms, while others we shyly conceal. Tattoo the moments of sorrow as well as the moments of splendor and beauty. Tattoo in an acknowledgment and tribute to home, and tattooing your beliefs that define who you are. Whether we intended to or not, every moment of our lives are tattooed to our heart.
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.
Some years ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods that I had accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly doubtful nature of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based on them. I realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations if I wanted to establish anything at all in the sciences that was stable and likely to last.
songs, to me, were more important than just light entertainment. They were my preceptor and guide into some altered consciousness of reality. Some different republic, some liberated republic... whatever the case, it wasn't that I was anti-popular culture or anything and I had no ambition to stir things up. I just thought of mainstream culture as lame as hell and a big trick. It was like the unbroken sea of frost that lay outside the window and you had to have awkward footgear to walk with.
Son, never trust a man who doesn't drink because he's probably a self-righteous sort, a man who thinks he knows right from wrong all the time. Some of them are good men, but in the name of goodness, they cause most of the suffering in the world. They're the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never trust a man who drinks but refuses to get drunk. They're usually afraid of something deep down inside, either that they're a coward or a fool or mean and violent. You can't trust a man who's afraid of himself. But sometimes, son, you can trust a man who occasionally kneels before a toilet. The chances are that he is learning something about humility and his natural human foolishness, about how to survive himself. It's damned hard for a man to take himself too seriously when he's heaving his guts into a dirty toilet bowl.
So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth.
Sorrow comes from fear, fear comes from insecurity, insecurity comes from psychological obscurity, which is the lack of wisdom.
Sorry to be a wet blanket.   Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard.   There's nothing to relate it to.
So that others can live in peace, talk about love and peace wherever you go.
Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success.
Sound methodology can empower and liberate the creative mind; it cannot inflame or inspire the drudge.
So - what are the most important problems in software engineering? I'd answer "dealing with complexity".
So, when on one side you hoist in Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.
So you think that money is the root of all evil? [...] Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?

Standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.
Stand in the divine rain, and seeds of wisdom will grow in your soul.
Staring at a world too horrible to comprehend, believing -- by dint of ignorance and innocence -- that beneath this unbearable contract of guilt and blame there is always an older contract that may bind and release in a more salutary way.
stars -- could all those stars set over barren planets, beauty wasted? Or, are sunsets witnessed throughout the universe?
Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.
Start every day off with a smile and get it over with.

Steroids do not guarantee you're going to have success. I think a lot of people think that they will, but they don't.
St. Francis of Assisi taught me that there is a wound in the Creation and that the greatest use we could make of our lives was to ask to be made a healer of it.
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
Still less, despite appearances, will it have been a collection of three "essays" whose itinerary it would be time, after the fact, to recognize; whose continuity and underlying laws could now be pointed out; indeed, whose overall concept or meaning could at last, with all the insistence required on such occasions, be squarely set forth. I will not feign, according to the code, either premeditation or improvisation. These texts are assembled otherwise; it is not my intention here to present them.
Stop acting weak. You have more power than you can imagine.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong, and start being excited about what could go right.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy.
Stop letting people who do so little for you control so much of your mind and emotions.
Stop thinking gratitude as a buy product of your circumstances and start thinking of it as a world view.

Strive to be first: first to nod, first to smile, first to compliment, and first to forgive.
Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause.
Students of the heavens are separable into astronomers and astrologers as readily as are the minor domestic ruminants into sheep and goats, but the separation of philosophers into sages and cranks seems to be more sensitive to frames of reference.
Students should be evaluated on how well they can achieve the goals they strived to achieve within a realistic context. Students need to learn to do things, not know things.

Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.

And there you are watching the bubbles in the primeval ooze. You don't have to concentrate. You don't have to react. You don't have to remember. You don't miss your brain because you don't need it. Your heart and liver and lungs continue to function normally. Apart from that, all is peace and quiet. You are in the man's nirvana.

That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
that you would not anticipate misery since the evils you dread as coming upon you may perhaps never reach you at least they are not yet come Thus some things torture us more than they ought, some before they ought and some which ought never to torture us at all. We heighten our pain either by presupposing a cause or anticipation
The abdomen, the chest, and the brain will forever be shut from the intrusion of the wise and humane surgeon.
The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.
The actuality of us being cognizant and accepting of the fact we are but a speck of sand in a universe sized desert, whose existence is irrelevant to any facet of universal function is a hard pill to swallow. Knowing the world will go on for another billion years after death and you will have no recollection of anything, just as you have no recollection of the billion years before your birth is a mind-boggling intuition,
The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.
The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.
The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, 'Seek simplicity and distrust it.

The art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.
The art of music is good, for the reason, among others, that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good?

The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.
The authentic self is the soul made visible.
The average person puts only 25% of his energy into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%.
The awful thing is that if i can forget they're people, it will be no different at all
The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot.
The battle of life is, in most cases, fought uphill; and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor. If there were no difficulties there would be no success; if there were nothing to struggle for, there would be nothing to be achieved.
The battles that count aren't the ones for gold medals. The struggles within yourself–the invisible battles inside all of us–that's where it's at.

The bond between husband and wife is a strong one. Suppose the man had hunted her out and brought her back. The memory of her acts would still be there, and inevitably, sooner or later, it would be cause for rancor. When there are crises, incidents, a woman should try to overlook them, for better or for worse, and make the bond into something durable. The wounds will remain, with the woman and with the man, when there are crises such as I have described. It is very foolish for a woman to let a little dalliance upset her so much that she shows her resentment openly. He has his adventures--but if he has fond memories of their early days together, his and hers, she may be sure that she matters. A commotion means the end of everything. She should be quiet and generous, and when something comes up that quite properly arouses her resentment she should make it known by delicate hints. The man will feel guilty and with tactful guidance he will mend his ways. Too much lenience can make a woman seem charmingly docile and trusting, but it can also make her seem somewhat wanting in substance. We have had instances enough of boats abandoned to the winds and waves.
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.

The command of our language is crucial to focusing our thoughts and communicating them with precision to others.
The common denominator of success is in forming the habit of doing the things that failures don't like to do.
The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind.
The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young.
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.
The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth. The great philosophers have always been able to clear away the complexities and see simple distinctions - simple once they are stated, vastly difficult before. If we are to follow them we too must be childishly simple in our questions - and maturely wise in our replies.
The complexity of our present trouble suggests as never before that we need to change our present concept of education. Education is not properly an industry, and its proper use is not to serve industries, either by job-training or by industry-subsidized research. It's proper use is to enable citizens to live lives that are economically, politically, socially, and culturally responsible. This cannot be done by gathering or "accessing" what we now call "information" - which is to say facts without context and therefore without priority. A proper education enables young people to put their lives in order, which means knowing what things are more important than other things; it means putting first things first.
[T]he concern of man is not his future but his present, not the world but his soul. We must be just, we must strive, we must engage ourselves with the business of the world for our own sake, because through that, and through contemplation in equal measure, our soul is purified and brought closer to the divine. ... Thought and deed conjoined are crucial. ... The attempt must be made; the outcome is irrelevant. Right action is a pale material reflection of the divine, but reflection it is, nonetheless. Define your goal and exert reason to accomplish it by virtuous action; successs or failure is secondary.
The connection between art and Christ is like the connection between sunlight and the sun. It is, in fact, the connection between Sonlight and the Son.
The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile "reformed."
The contemporary proliferation of bullshit also has deeper sources, in various forms of skepticism which deny that we can have any reliable access to an objective reality and which therefore reject the possibility of knowing how things truly are. These "anti-realist" doctrines undermine confidence in the value of disinterested efforts to determine what is true and what is false, and even in the intelligibility of the notion of objective inquiry. One response to this loss of confidence has been a retreat from the discipline required by dedication to the ideal of correctness to a quite different sort of discipline, which is imposed by pursuit of an alternative ideal of sincerity. Rather than seeking primarily to arrive at accurate representations of a common world, the individual turns toward trying to provide honest representations of himself. Convinced that reality has no inherent nature, which he might hope to identify as the truth about things, he devotes himself to being true to his own nature. It is as though he decides that since it makes no sense to try to be true to the facts, he must therefore try instead to be true to himself.
The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called "model agnosticism" and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself.
The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.
The cost of our success is the exhaustion of natural resources, leading to energy crises, climate change, pollution, and the destruction of our habitat. If you exhaust natural resources, there will be nothing left for your children. If we continue in the same direction, humankind is headed for some frightful ordeals, if not extinction.
The cost of peace is war.
The craving for equality can express itself either as a desire to pull everyone down to our own level or as a desire to raise ourselves up along with everyone else.

The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest-Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.

The culture of a workplace - an organization's values, norms and practices - has a huge impact on our happiness and success.
The cure for anything is salt water. Sweat, tears or the ocean.

The danger today is in believing there are no sick people, there is only a sick society.
The darkening of the world makes the irrationality of art rational: radically darkened art.
The darkness behind my closed eyelids was like the cloud-covered sky, but the gray was somewhat deeper. Every few minutes, someone would come and paint over the gray with a different-textured gray - one with a touch of gold or green or red. I was impressed with the variety of grays that existed. Human beings were so strange. All you had to do was sit still for ten minutes, and you could see this amazing variety of grays.
The day may come when the rest of animal creation
The day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself he becomes wise.
The day the power of love overrules the love of power, the world will know peace.
The deadliest weapon in the world is a MARINE and his rifle!
The decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success. It is not intelligent. It is not beautiful. It is not just. It is not virtuous. And it doesn't deliver the goods.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest altitudes of his spirit.
The delight we take in our senses is an implicit desire to know the ultimate reason for things, the highest cause. The desire for wisdom that philosophy etymologically is is a desire for the highest or divine causes. Philosophy culminates in theology. All other knowledge contains the seeds of contemplation of the divine.
The development of human civilization over the course of millennia was really fascinating. Let us imagine, however, how high a level of development could have been reached if all amazing ideas of the great minds of the past had been realized. Let us consider, for example, some ideas of Nikola
The development of man's intellectual capacities has far outstripped the development of his emotions. Man's brain lives in the twentieth century; the heart of most men lives still in the Stone Age. The majority of men have not yet acquired the maturity to be independent, to be rational, to be objective. They need myths and idols to endure the fact that man is all by himself, that there is no authority which gives meaning to life except man himself.
The development of our human resources is an area in which we need to do well as it is decisive in determining the success of our diversification programme.
The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that account he keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the oldest friend of knowledge.
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination.
The difference between try and triumph is a little umph.
The difference between us and them, between you and success, is not that you never fail, but it's how you recover from those failures - is that you keep getting up time and time again. You figure out what you did wrong, and then you make it right. I say that to my kids every day.
The difficult is what takes a little time; the impossible is what takes a little longer.
The direct pursuit of happiness is a recipe for an unhappy life.
The disappointed one speaks. I searched for great human beings; I always found only the apes of their ideals.
The discovery of what is true and the practice of that which is good are the two most important aims of philosophy.
The disease of the soul is both more common and more deadly than the disease of the body. Just as medicine is the art devoted to healing the body, so philosophy is the art devoted to healing the soul, curing it of improper emotions, false beliefs, and faulty judgments, which are the causes of so much hardship and handicap. To heal the body one turns to the practitioner of the art of healing the body, but to heal the soul there is no doctor to turn to, and each of us is left to become that doctor unto himself. Yet, this need not stop us from exhorting others to imitate us in the godly art, in the forlorn hope that they might transform themselves into better citizens for Athens and better companions for us.
The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.

The easy confidence with which I know another man's religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also.
The effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer.
The egocentric is always frustrated, simply because the condition of self-perfection is self-surrender. There must be a willingness to die to the lower part of self, before there can be a birth to the nobler.

The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another's, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, are to me continual spiritual exercises.
The fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live-moreover, the only one.
The failure to read good books both enfeebles the vision and strengthens our most fatal tendency - the belief that the here and now is all there is.
The fame of heroes owes little to the extent of their conquests and all to the success of the tributes paid to them.
The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be returned.
The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly.
The first and most important field of philosophy is the application of principles such as "Do not lie." Next come the proofs, such as why we should not lie. The third field supports and articulates the proofs, by asking, for example, "How does this prove it? What exactly is a proof, what is logical inference, what is contradiction, what is truth, what is falsehood?" Thus, the third field is necessary because of the second, and the second because of the first. The most important, though, the one that should occupy most of our time, is the first. But we do just the opposite. We are preoccupied with the third field and give that all our attention, passing the first by altogether. The result is that we lie -- but have no difficulty proving why we shouldn't.
The first and most important step toward success is the feeling that we can succeed.
The first and most important thing an individual can do is to become an individual again, decontrol himself, train himself as to what is going on and win back as much independent ground for himself as possible

The fossil record implies trial and error, the inability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with a Great Designer (though not a Designer of a more remote and indirect temperament.)
The foundation of success in life is good health: that is the substratum fortune; it is also the basis of happiness. A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick.
The foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty.
The freedom of an unscheduled afternoon brought confusion rather than joy. Julius had always been focused. When he was not seeing patients, other important projects and activities-writing, teaching, tennis, research-clamored for his attention. But today nothing seemed important. He suspected that nothing had ever been important, that his mind had arbitrarily imbued projects with importance and then cunningly covered its traces. Today he saw through the ruse of a lifetime. Today there was nothing important to do, and he ambled aimlessly down Union Street.

The future of America is not an entitlement. We have been given a treasure chest of gifts and opportunities, but some people are being left behind, and success is not sustainable unless it is shared.
The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.

The graduate with a Science degree asks, "Why does it work?" The graduate with an Engineering degree asks, "How does it work?" The graduate with an Accounting degree asks, "How much will it cost?" The graduate with a Liberal Arts degree asks, "Do you want fries with that?"
The great dividing line between success and failure can be expressed in five words: "I did not have time."
The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.
The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.

The greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition.
The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.

The handicap of deafness is not in the ear; it is in the mind.
The happiest moments my heart knows are those in which it is pouring forth its affections to a few esteemed characters.
The happiest people I have known have been those who gave themselves no concern about their own souls, but did their uttermost to mitigate the miseries of others.
The happy heart runs with the river, floats on the air, lifts to the music, soars with the eagle, hopes with the prayer.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
The harder the fall, the higher the bounce.
The hardest bones, containing the richest marrow, can be conquered only by a united crushing of all the teeth of all dogs. That of course is only a figure of speech and exaggerated; if all teeth were but ready they would not need even to bite, the bones would crack themselves and the marrow would be freely accessible to the feeblest of dogs. If I remain faithful to this metaphor, then the goal of my aims, my questions, my inquiries, appears monstrous, it is true. For I want to compel all dogs thus to assemble together, I want the bones to crack open under the pressure of their collective preparedness, and then I want to dismiss them to the ordinary life they love, while all by myself, quite alone, I lap up the marrow. That sounds monstrous, almost as if I wanted to feed on the marrow, not merely of bone, but of the whole canine race itself. But it is only a metaphor. The marrow that I am discussing here is no food; on the contrary, it is a poison.
The hardest part of being alone, is being alone.
The hardest part of design ... is keeping features out.
The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially the more success you have, the more you look to the other side of the gate. What do I need to stay grounded, in touch, in love, connected, emotionally balanced? Look within yourself.
The hardships that I encountered in the past will help me succeed in the future.
The heart has reason which reason cannot understand.
The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man's head because she turns his heart.

The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free.
The highest of distinctions is service to others.
The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination, by itself, would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor, while expanding opportunities for economic betterment.
The history of the world is the history of a few people who had faith in themselves.
The hope, and not the fact, of advancement, is the spur to industry.
The human body resonates at the same frequency as Mother Earth. So instead of only focusing on trying to save the earth, which operates in congruence to our vibrations, I think it is more important to be one with each other. If you really want to remedy the earth, we have to mend mankind. And to unite mankind, we heal the Earth. That is the only way. Mother Earth will exist with or without us. Yet if she is sick, it is because mankind is sick and separated. And if our vibrations are bad, she reacts to it, as do all living creatures.
The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stops until you stand up to speak in public.
The human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it.
The ideal life is in our blood and never will be still.
The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas.
The illness of a doctor is always worse than the illnesses of his patients.The patients only feel, but the doctor, as well as feeling, has a pretty good idea of the destructive effect of the disease on his constitution.This is a case in which knowledge brings death nearer.

The inner revolution will not be televised or sold on the Internet. It must take place within one's own mind and heart.
The intellectual attainments of a man who thinks for himself resemble a fine painting, where the light and shade are correct, the tone sustained, the colour perfectly harmonised; it is true to life. On the other hand, the intellectual attainments of the mere man of learning are like a large palette, full of all sorts of colours, which at most are systematically arranged, but devoid of harmony, connection and meaning.
The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.
The internet neutrality is dead in the water thanks to greedy individuals, corporations and their backers.
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.
Their [philosophers] thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.
Theism is a conclusion, so is atheism - none of these two conclusions is the product of serious investigation - one is born from the human's primitive urge to believe, and the other is born from the human's comparatively modern arrogance of radical reasoning. Neither of them truly wants to understand - rather both of them want to conclude on a matter that requires infinite patience, perseverance and naivety.
The job of a leader today is not to create followers. It's to create more leaders.
The journey is the reward.
The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.
The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.
The keys to brand success are self-definition, transparency, authenticity and accountability.
The keys to patience are acceptance and faith. Accept things as they are, and look realistically at the world around you. Have faith in yourself and in the direction you have chosen.
The key to accepting responsibility for your life is to accept the fact that your choices, every one of them, are leading you inexorably to either success or failure, however you define those terms.
The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.
The key to success is action, and the essential in action is perseverance.
The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear.

The law sometimes sleeps, but never dies.
The leaders who we admire who have been able to bring great change in the past - Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela - they're all inspirational religious leaders and smart tacticians. It would be nice to find the Muslim Gandhi, wouldn't it?
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.
The lesson we are indebted to Egypt for, our future generations learned that in the face of oppression silence is never golden.
The level of our success is limited only by our imagination and no act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted.
The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perceptions.
The life of the enemy . Whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemy's staying alive.
The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible.
The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.
The line between him and the enemy had simultaneously blurred and solidified. Somehow, while perhaps it shouldn't have, this thought provided a strange sense of peace.
The lion and the calf shall lie down together but the calf won't get much sleep.
The living self has one purpose only: to come into its own fullness of being.
The logical man must either deny all miracles or none.
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.
The longer you hang in there, the greater the chance that something will happen in your favor. No matter how hard it seems, the longer you persist, the more likely your success.
The longing for Paradise is man's longing not to be man.
Thelonious Monk was one of the musicians I most connected with early on. I'm a huge Betty Carter fan, and the way that Abbey Lincoln and Shirley Horn grew immensely from the time they were young is so inspirational.
The love of money is the root of all evil, therefore selfishness must be the seed.
The love of what you do, combined with your belief in what you do, will not determine your success. It will determine how hard you will work and how dedicated you will be to achieving it. Success just shows up from there.
The lurking suspicion that something could be simplified is the world's richest source of rewarding challenges.
The main thing is to be moved, to love, to hope, to tremble, to live.
The major cause [of the software crisis] is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem. In this sense the electronic industry has not solved a single problem, it has only created them, it has created the problem of using its products.
The making of friends who are real friends, is the best token we have of a man's success in life.
The manic pursuit of success cost me everything I could love: my wife, my three children, some friends I would have liked to grow old with.

The man on top of the mountain didn't fall there.
The man who alters his way of thinking to suit others is a fool.
The man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful is the man who will win.
The Man Who Has Confidence In Himself Gains The Confidence Of Others.
The man who has done his level best... is a success, even though the world may write him down a failure.
The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason.
The man who has not the habit of reading is imprisoned in his immediate world, in respect to time and space. His life falls into a set routine; he is limited to contact and conversation with a few friends and acquaintances, and he sees only what happens in his immediate neighbourhood. From this prison there is no escape. But the moment he takes up a book, he immediately enters a different world, and if it is a good book, he is immediately put in touch with one of the best talkers of the world. This talker leads him on and carries him into a different country or a different age, or unburdens to him some of his personal regrets, or discusses with him some special line or aspect of life that the reader knows nothing about. An ancient author puts him in communion with a dead spirit of long ago, and as he reads along, he begins to imagine what the ancient author looked like and what type of person he was.
The man who says that all events are necessitated has no ground for critizing the man who says that not all events are necessitated. For according to him this is itself a necessitated event.
The map is not the territory.
The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.
The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play.
THE MAXIMS OF MEDICINE
The meaning I picked, the one that changed my life: Overcome fear, behold wonder.
The meaning of earthly existence lies not, as we have grown used to thinking, in prospering but in the development of the soul.
The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.
The measure of a man is what he does with power.
The measure of success is happiness and peace of mind.
The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year.
The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have.
The menu is not the meal.
The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages ; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.
The mind always fails first, not the body. The secret is to make your mind work for you, not against you.
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.
The mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own and is not shared with the body.
The mind that tries to shape tomorrow beyond its capacities will find no rest.
The minute you put the blame on someone else you've switch things from being a problem you can control to a problem outside of your control.
The mode by which the inevitable comes to pass is effort.
The modern habit of saying "This is my opinion, but I may be wrong" is entirely irrational. If I say that it may be wrong, I say that is not my opinion. The modern habit of saying "Every man has a different philosophy; this is my philosophy and it suits me" -- the habit of saying this is mere weak-mindedness. A cosmic philosophy is not constructed to fit a man; a cosmic philosophy is constructed to fit a cosmos. A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a private sun and moon.
The moment we believe that success is determined by an ingrained level of ability as opposed to resilience and hard work, we will be brittle in the face of adversity.
The moment we cry in a film is not when things are sad but when they turn out to be more beautiful than we expected them to be.

The more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success.
The more details, depth and thought you put into your ideas the more valuable they become.
The more he identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and his own desires. The spectacle's estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by the fact that the individual's gestures are no longer his own; they are the gestures of someone else who represents them to him.
The more I love, the more I find that life is magical.
The more invested I am in my own ideas about reality, the more those experiences will feel like victimizations rather than the ups and downs of relating. Actually, I believe that the less I conceptualize things that way, the more likely it is that people will want to stay by me, because they will not feel burdened, consciously or unconsciously, by my projections, judgments, entitlements, or unrealistic expectations.
The more I want to get something done, the less I call it work.
The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.
The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one's appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship.

The more we do the more we can do.
The more we do, the more we can do.
The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique.
The more you love, the more you suffer.
The more you open your heart to others, the more your life becomes joyful.
The more you struggle to live, the less you live. Give up the notion that you must be sure of what you are doing. Instead, surrender to what is real within you, for that alone is sure....you are above everything distressing.
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.
The most amazing people are those who love themselves truly and love others endlessly.
The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering.
The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.
The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself.
The most boring and unproductive question one can ask of any religion is whether or not it is true.
The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.
The most damaging phrase in the language is, It's always been done that way.
..the most dangerous animal in a zoo is Man.
The most dangerous irony is, people are angry with others because of their own incompetence.
The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.
The most effective way to do it, is to do it.
The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments.
... the most important concept ever put forth was that matter, ALL matter, with no exceptions from stone to star to starfish to student to sovereign, is as divine as all else in the cosmos, for all flows from Consciousness, the Word that came before the World - and all, in time, will flow back.
The most important investment you can make is in yourself.
The most important key to achieving great success is to decide upon your goal and launch, get started, take action, move.

The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.
The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion.
The most total opposite of pleasure is not pain but boredom, for we are willing to risk pain to make a boring life interesting.
The most unambiguous sign that a person holds men in low esteem is this: That he either acknowledges them merely as means to his ends or does not acknowledge them at all.
The most unlucky generation is the one which couldn't produce a hero to look upto.
The most violent revolutions in an individual's beliefs leave most of his old order standing. Time and space, cause and effect, nature and history, and one's own biography remain untouched. New truth is always a go-between, a smoother-over of transitions. It marries old opinion to new fact so as ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of continuity. We hold a theory true just in proportion to its success in solving this 'problem of maxima and minima.' But success in solving this problem is eminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory solves it on the whole more satisfactorily than that theory; but that means more satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize their points of satisfaction differently.
The move of the embassy was not an economic one, at least not on the surface anyway. It wasn't even to placate a host nation or the nation on the move. It was used to inflame the masses so that conflict could continue.
The mythology of your culture hums in your ears so constantly that no one pays the slightest bit of attention to it. Of course man is conquering space and the atom and the deserts and the oceans and the elements. According to your mythology, this is what he was BORN to do.
The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure but from hope to hope.
The nature of the Hebrew Bible and traditional Judaism, if we insist upon using Latin terms, is orthoprax, which literally means correct practice, implying that Biblical religion and traditional Talmudic Judaism demand right behavior (ethically and ritually) but no formal theological dogma.
The necessity of reform mustn't be allowed to become a form of blackmail serving to limit, reduce, or halt the exercise of criticism. Under no circumstances should one pay attention to those who tell one: "Don't criticize, since you're not capable of carrying out a reform." That's ministerial cabinet talk. Critique doesn't have to be the premise of a deduction that concludes, "this, then, is what needs to be done." It should be an instrument for those for who fight, those who resist and refuse what is. Its use should be in processes of conflict and confrontation, essays in refusal. It doesn't have to lay down the law for the law. It isn't a stage in a programming. It is a challenge directed to what is.
The negative side of the American Dream comes when people pursue success at any cost, which in turn destroys the vision and the dream.
The negotiations were simultaneously cerebral and physical, abstract and personal, something like a combination of chess and mountain climbing.
The NFL is a performance-based business, so you should have to perform to earn some of your money. At the same time, I realize that my success isn't just because of what I do out there.
Then the lover, who is true and no counterfeit, must of necessity be loved by his love.
The number of stressors has multiplied exponentially: traffic, money, success, work/life balance, the economy, the environment, parenting, family conflict, relationships, disease. As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn't been able to keep up.
The number one reason people fail in life is because they listen to their friends, family, and neighbors.
Then we're just sitting there, staring at each other. Which has been happening a lot lately. It's like
The old man slowly raised himself from the piano stool, fixed those cheerful blue eyes piercingly and at the same time with unimaginable friendliness upon him, and said: "Making music together is the best way for two people to become friends. There is none easier. That is a fine thing. I hope you and I shall remain friends. Perhaps you too will learn how to make fugues, Joseph.
Theology, philosophy, metaphysics, and quantum physics are merely ways for God to have his smart people believe in him

The only debatable issue, it seems to me, is whether it is more ridiculous to turn to experts in social theory for general well-confirmed propositions, or to the specialists in the great religions and philosophical systems for insights into fundamental human values.

The only thing even in this world is the number of hours in a day. The difference in winning or losing is what you do with those hours.
The only thing I'm addicted to is winning. This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5 percent success rate. My success rate is 100 percent.
The only thing standing between you and your dreams is ... reluctance.
The only thing that interests the physicist is finding out on what assumptions a framework of things can be constructed which will enable us to know how to use them mechanically. Physics, as I have said on another occasion, is the technique of techniques and the ars combinatoria for fabricating machines. It is a knowledge which has scarcely anything to do with comprehension.
The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.
The only thing that ultimately matters is to eat an ice-cream cone, play a slide trombone, plant a small tree, good God, now you're free.

The only way to work is to love what you do.
The only way we'll get freedom for ourselves is to identify ourselves with every oppressed people in the world. We are blood brothers to the people of Brazil, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba -- yes Cuba too.
The only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion. No one remembers anything else.

The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.
The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.
The optimist underestimates how difficult it is to achieve real change, believing that anything is possible and it's possible now. Only by confronting head-on the reality that all progress is going to be obstructed by vested interests and corrupted by human venality can we create realistic programmes that actually have a chance of success.

The philosopher is a person who refuses no pleasures which do not produce greater sorrows, and who knows how to create new ones.
The philosophers have only
The Philosopher's Motto: I came, I saw, I pondered!
The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you ought not to go out of it with pleasure, but with pain. For you are not in sound health when you enter.
The philosophers write about things as they are and as they appear to be, but as an artist I find that appearance is everything.
The philosopher whose dealings are with divine order himself acquires the characteristics of order and divinity.
The philosophic outlook rises above all sectarian controversy. It finds its own position not only by appreciating and synthesizing what is solidly based in the rival sects but also by capping them all with the keystone of nonduality.
The philosophy of poetry must acknowledge that the poetic act has no past, at least no recent past, in which its preparation and appearance could be followed.
The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety") of the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus. Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church, characteristic of the type "free spirit"--as ITS non-freedom.
The pianokeys are black and white
The pity of it was that this discovery, if such it was, now seemed so stale, so profitless to me. What good was it? What good did thinking ever do?
The point of modernity is to live a life without illusions while not becoming disillusioned
The poor man is not he who is without a cent, but he who is without a dream.
The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can anyone conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear, we would probably be left completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.
The possibilities are numerous once we decide to act and not react.
The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it.
The power of a movement lies in the fact that it can indeed change the habits of people. This change is not the result of force but of dedication, of moral persuasion.
The power of an air force is terrific when there is nothing to oppose it.
The power of death signifies that this real world can only have a neutral image of life, that life's intimacy does not reveal it's dazzling consumption until the moment it gives out.
The power of imagination makes us infinite.
The power of pop culture stories should not be underestimated, and there is an enormous potential for inspirational stories that can have a positive, transformative effect on our lives.
The present convergence of crises----in money, energy, education, health, water, soil, climate, politics, the environment, and more----is a birth crisis, expelling us from the old world into a new.
The pre-Socratic Greek philosopher
THE PRESOCRATIC PROBLEM
The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.
The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.
The price we have paid for expecting to be so much more than our ancestors is a perpetual anxiety that we are far from being all we might be.
[T]he price you've paid is not the price of becoming human. It's not even the price of having the things you just mentioned. It's the price of enacting a story that casts mankind as the enemy of the world.
The priest therefore saw what the anchorite could not. That God needs no witness. Neither to himself nor against. The truth is rather that if there were no God then there could be no witness for there could be no identity to the world but only each man's opinion of it. The priest saw that there is no man who is elect because there is no man who is not. To God every man is a heretic.
The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.
The primitive tribes permitted far less individual freedom than does modern society. Ancient wars were committed with far less moral justification than modern ones. A technology that produces debris can find, and is finding, ways of disposing of it without ecological upset. And the schoolbook pictures of primitive man sometimes omit some of the detractions of his primitive life - the pain, the disease, famine, the hard labor needed just to stay alive. From that agony of bare existence to modern life can be soberly described only as upward progress, and the sole agent for this progress is quite clearly reason itself.
The principle of democracy is a recognition of the sovereign, inalienable rights of man as a gift from God, the Source of law.
The problem is that Microsoft just has no taste. And I don't mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way.
The problem is that small examples fail to convince, and large examples are too big to follow.

The progress of the world can certainly never come at all save by the modified action of the individual beings who compose the world.
The proper response, as Hanukkah teaches, is not to curse the darkness but to light a candle.
The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
The Purpose of Philosophy is to fall in Love. To strip the world of all its clothes, and fall in Love with it as it stand before you completely naked.
The question has often been asked; Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy? It does not matter what you call it. Buddhism remains what it is whatever label you may put on it. The label is immaterial. Even the label 'Buddhism' which we give to the teachings of the Buddha is of little importance. The name one gives is inessential.... In the same way Truth needs no label: it is neither Buddhist, Christian, Hindu nor Moslem. It is not the monopoly of anybody. Sectarian labels are a hindrance to the independent understanding of Truth, and they produce harmful prejudices in men's minds.
The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me.
The question of whether Machines Can Think... is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.
The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong - but that's the way to bet.
The ramdomness of events in the world is so lacking in logic that we give it names like destiny, fate, karma and kismat to deal with the irrationality of its sequence
...the rarest of all human qualities is consistency.
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
The real community of man, in the midst of all the self-contradictory simulacra of community, is the community of those who seek the truth, of the potential knowers...of all men to the extent they desire to know. But in fact, this includes only a few, the true friends, as Plato was to Aristotle at the very moment they were disagreeing about the nature of the good...They were absolutely one soul as they looked at the problem. This, according to Plato, is the only real friendship, the only real common good. It is here that the contact people so desperately seek is to be found...This is the meaning of the riddle of the improbable philosopher-kings. They have a true community that is exemplary for all other communities.
The real community of man...is the community of those who seek the truth, of the potential knowers.
The real end winner of NAFTA is going to be Mexico because we have the human capital. We have that resource that is vital to the success of the U.S. economy.
The real enemy" is the totality of physical and mental constraints by which capital, or class society, or statism, or the society of the spectacle expropriates everyday life, the time of our lives. The real enemy is not an object apart from life. It is the organization of life by powers detached from it and turned against it. The apparatus, not its personnel, is the real enemy. But it is by and through the apparatchiks and everyone else participating in the system that domination and deception are made manifest. The totality is the organization of all against each and each against all. It includes all the policemen, all the social workers, all the office workers, all the nuns, all the op-ed columnists, all the drug kingpins from Medellin to Upjohn, all the syndicalists and all the situationists.
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.
The real question of life after death isn't whether or not it exists, but even if it does what problem this really solves.
The real secret of success is enthusiasm.
The real success in golf lies in turning three shots into two.
the Real-World was a sprawling mess of a book in need of a good editor.
There are 10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die. This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends and baffled my accountant. If I had not picked up this habit in the library long ago, I would have more money in the bank today; I would not be richer.
There are 10 types of people in this world; those who understand the binary number system and those who do not
There are a lot of things that go into creating success. I don't like to do just the things I like to do. I like to do things that cause the company to succeed. I don't spend a lot of time doing my favorite activities.
There are cases in which we are like horses, we psychologists, and become restless: we see our own shadow wavering up and down before us. A psychologist must turn his eyes from himself to eye anything at all.
There are certain circumstances, which, at the time of their happening, are a kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be followed by its answer, so those kind of circumstances will be followed by their events, and those events are always the true solution. A considerable space of time may lapse between, and unless we continue our observations from the one to the other, the harmony of them will pass away unnoticed: but the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing necessity of some instant things, and partly from the impatience of our own tempers, we are frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning of everything as fast as it happens, that we thereby never truly understand it; and not only start new difficulties to ourselves by so doing, but, as it were, embarrass Providence in her good designs.
There are glimpses of heaven to us in every act, or thought, or word, that raises us above ourselves.
There are many ways to avoid success in life, but the most sure-fire just might be procrastination.
There are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct which they have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings; as a religious bigot, when charged with disregarding the religious feelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard his feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or creed. But there is no parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion, and the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more than between the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of the right owner to keep it. And a person's taste is as much his own peculiar concern as his opinion or his purse. It is easy for any one to imagine an ideal public, which leaves the freedom and choice of individuals in all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstain from modes of conduct which universal experience has condemned. But where has there been seen a public which set any such limit to its censorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universal experience. In its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently from itself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held up to mankind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine tenths of all moralists and speculative writers. These teach that things are right because they are right; because we feel them to be so. They tell us to search in our own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding on ourselves and on all others. What can the poor public do but apply these instructions, and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world?
There are many wonderful things that will never be done if you do not do them.
There are no bad words. Bad thoughts. Bad intentions, and wooooords.
There are no free lunches in philosophy any more than in real life.
There are no ordinary moments.
There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves.
There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.

There are people who can achieve huge success in life, while adding a bit of fun and a splash of colour to this increasingly grey world.
There are people who make things happen, there are people who watch things happen, and there are people who wonder what happened. To be successful, you need to be a person who makes things happen.
There are physical characteristics which are inherited. These include things like good looks, high intelligence, physical coordination. These attributes contribute to success in life, and success in life is a determinant of optimism.
There are situations in life which are beyond one. The sensible man realizes this, and slides out of such situations, admitting himself beaten. Others try to grapple with them, but it never does any good. When affairs get in a real tangle, it is best to sit still and let them straighten themselves out. Or, if one does not do that, simply to think no more about them. This is Philosophy. The true philosopher is the man who says "All right," and goes to sleep in his arm-chair. One's attitude towards Life's Little Difficulties should be that of the gentleman in the fable, who sat down on an acorn one day and happened to doze. The warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate, and it grew so rapidly that, when he awoke, he found himself sitting in the fork of an oak sixty feet from the ground. He thought he would go home, but, finding this impossible, he altered his plans. "Well, well," he said, "if I cannot compel circumstances to my will, I can at least adapt my will to circumstances. I decide to remain here." Which he did, and had a not unpleasant time. The oak lacked some of the comforts of home, but the air was splendid and the view excellent.
There are so many kinds of time. The time by which we measure our lives. Months and years. Or the
There are souls in this world which have the gift of finding joy everywhere and of leaving it behind them when they go.
There are strong people and there are people who claim to be strong. Strong people can conquer and survive anything , but people who claim to be strong lose and suffer in everything they do. The reason is people who claim to be strong don't know that being strong it doesn't mean you should not accept help or ask for help when needed. For them being strong Is faking doing well, holding pain and not crying and doing everything on their own. You are only strong when you admit your situation and on what's really happening and find ways to deal with it. Sometimes might mean asking for help.
There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why... I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?
There are thousands of inspirational stories waiting to be told about young women who yearn for a great education. They are stories of struggle and stories of success, and they will inspire others to take action and work to change lives.
There are thousands of pages written about bitcoin. None of them spell it BitCoin. Therefore you have read none of them if you spell it thus.

There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one's self.
There are times when wisdom cannot be found in the chambers of parliament or the halls of academia but at the unpretentious setting of the kitchen table.
There are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.

There are two kinds of people in this world: Those who believe there are two kinds of people in this world and those who are smart enough to know better.
There are two kinds of people, those who do the work and those who take the credit. Try to be in the first group; there is less competition there.
There are two kinds of people, those who finish what they start and so on.
There are two rules for success... 1) Never tell everything you know.
There are two things people want more than sex and money... recognition and praise.
There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.
There are two ways of constructing a piece of software: One is to make it so simple that there are obviously no errors, and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious errors.
There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
The reason a lot of people do not recognize opportunity is because it usually goes around wearing overalls looking like hard work.
The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.
The reason that I stopped living was because I died.
The reason to do animation is caricature. Good caricature picks out the essense of the statement and removes everything else. It's not simply about reproducing reality; It's about bumping it up.
There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.
There can only be one state of mind as you approach any profound test; total concentration, a spirit of togetherness, and strength.
There comes a day when my skin just wants to breathe and get out of my clothes.
Therefore hold to the things which are reliable. Look to simplicity; embrace purity; Lessen the self; diminish desire.
Therefore, if one were to consider that there was virtually no possibility of success through the US-Japan negotiations, the military and economic pressures would only force Japan into further crisis if time were allowed to pass in vain.
There has been an alarming increase in the number of things you know absolutely nothing about.
There have been many different artists that have been inspirational. I suppose the question is directed to what was the reason why I went into fantasy illustration.
There is a common tendency to turn off one's imagination at certain points and refuse to contemplate the possibility of having to do certain things and cope with the attendant moral problems. The things simply get done by the social machine, and one can keep one's clear conscience and one's moral indignation unsullied.
There is a current perception is that science has overtaken Philosophy and in effect rendered Philosophy irrelevant.
There is a danger there - a very real danger to humanity. Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. The spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. It would be the survival of the least fit. What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?
There is a destiny that makes us brothers, No one goes his way alone; All that we send into the lives of others, Comes back into our own.
There is a hatred of lies and simulation, stemming from an easily provoked sense of honor. There is another such hatred, from cowardice, since lies are forbidden by a divine commandment. Too cowardly to lie.
There is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of wickedness.
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher.
There is always room at the top.
There is a miracle in your mess, don't let the mess make you miss the miracle.
There is an immutable conflict at work in life and in business, a constant battle between peace and chaos. Neither can be mastered, but both can be influenced. How you go about that is the key to success.
There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a cause.
There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.
There is a perennial classical question that asks which part of the motorcycle, which grain of sand in which pile, is the Buddha. Obviously to ask that question is to look in the wrong direction, for the Buddha is everywhere. But just as obviously to ask the question is to look in the right direction, for the Buddha is everwhere.
There is ascension to potential that Plato couldn't conceive while prescribing idealism to conception as highest existences. With Streams, there isn't a difference between ideas and instantiations. They are both authenticated within all possibilities in Stream, within the Primal Cause as ordered. Ideas as ordered constructs in consciousness, instantiations as ordered effects.
There is a truth in Schopenhauer's view that philosophy is an organism, and that a book on philosophy, with a beginning and end, is a sort of contradiction. ... In philosophy matters are not simple enough for us to say 'Let's get a rough idea', for we do not know the country except by knowing the connections between the roads.
There is a wonderful mythical law of nature that the three things we crave most in life-happiness, freedom, and peace of mind-are always attained by giving them to someone else.
There is but one true philosophical problem and that is suicide.
There is desire in the perfect, beauty in the imperfect.
There is freedom to found in the prayers of unconditional love and kindness.
There is incredible value in being of service to others.
There is just a lot of creativity and theatricality in performers who happen to be gay. Maybe there's a success in numbers, so by the law of averages we are going to get these jobs.
There is little success where there is little laughter.
There is more hunger for love and appreciation in this world than for bread.
There is much in this vision that will remind you of your mystics; yet between them and us there is far more difference than similarity, in respect both of the matter and the manner of our thought. For while they are confident that the cosmos is perfect, we are sure only that it is very beautiful. While they pass to their conclusion without the aid of intellect, we have used that staff every step of the way. Thus, even when in respect of conclusions we agree with your mystics rather than your plodding intellectuals, in respect of method we applaud most your intellectuals; for they scorned to deceive themselves with comfortable fantasies.
There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is merely the comparison of one state to the other. Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.
There is never just one thing that leads to success for anyone. I feel it always a combination of passion, dedication, hard work, and being in the right place at the right time.
There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul.
There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. And just as such a document is not free of barbarism, barbarism taints also the manner in which it was transmitted. A historical materialist therefore dissociates himself from it as far as possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.
There is no easy way from the earth to the stars.
There is no elevator to success.
There is no fate which cannot be surmounted by scorn.
There is no force like success, and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it; as of the individual, so should it be of the nation.
There is no friend like a sister.
There is no future without a past, because what is to be cannot be imagined except as a form of repetition.
There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery
There is no investment you can make which will pay you so well as the effort to scatter sunshine and good cheer through your establishment.
There is no justice in the laws of nature, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The Universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky.
There is no key to open the heart of another - except curiosity.
There is no man, and no place, without war. The only thing we can do is choose a side, and fight. That is the only choice we get - who we fight for, who we fight against. That is life.
There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, just be happy. You are already free!
There is no part of one's beliefs about oneself which cannot be modified by sufficiently powerful psychological techniques. There is nothing about oneself which cannot be taken away or changed. The proper stimuli can, if correctly applied, turn communists into fascists, saints into devils, the meek into heroes, and vice-versa. There is no sovereign sanctuary within ourseles which represents our real nature. There is nobody at home in the internal fortress. Everything we cherish as our ego, everything we believe in, is just what we have cobbled together out of the accident of our birth and subsequent experiences. With drugs, brainwashing, and other techniques of extreme persuasion, we can quite readily make a man a devotee of a different ideology, the patriot of a different country, or the follower of a different religion.
There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.
There is no problem more difficult to solve than that created by ourselves.
There is no problem unless we choose to make it one, so think carefully before you act.
There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.
There is no revenge so complete as forgiveness.
There is no scientific answer for success. You can't define it. You've simply got to live it and do it.
There is no security on the Earth, there is only opportunity.
There is no shame in making an honest effort.
There is no sickness worse for me than words that to be kind must lie.
There is no substitute for hard work.
There is no substitute for hard work, 23 or 24 hours a day. And there is no substitute for patience and acceptance.
There is no substitute for victory.
There is no success without hardship.
There is no such thing as educational value in the abstract. The notion that some subjects and methods and that acquaintance with certain facts and truths possess educational value in and of themselves is the reason why traditional education reduced the material of education so largely to a diet of predigested materials.
There is no such thing as luck. There is only adequate or inadequate preparation to cope with a statistical universe.
There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena.
There is no such thing as objectivity. We are all just interpreting signals from the universe and trying to make sense of them. Dim, shaky, weak, static-y little signals that only hint at the complexity of a universe we cannot begin to understand.
There is no surer way to ruin a good discussion than to contaminate it with facts.
There is no teaching to compare with example.
There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.
There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
There is nothing impossible to him who will try.
There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
There is nothing more natural than to consider everything as starting from oneself, chosen as the center of the world; one finds oneself thus capable of condemning the world without even wanting to hear its deceitful chatter.
There is nothing more notable in
There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequal people.
There is nothing more wonderful than a book. It may be a message to us from the dead, from human souls we never saw who lived perhaps thousands of miles away, and yet these little sheets of paper speak to us, arouse us, teach us, open our hearts and in turn open their hearts to us like brothers. Without books, God is silent, justice dormant, philosophy lame.
There is nothing permanent except change.
There is nothing so stable as change.
There is nothing strange when you come to know it.
There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness.
There is not much to be got anywhere in the world. It is filled with misery and pain; if a man escapes these, boredeom lies in wait for him at every corner. Nay more; it is evil which generally has the upper hand, and folly that makes the most noise. Fate is cruel and mankind pitiable.
There is not one big cosmic meaning for all, there is only the meaning we each give to our life.
There is no traffic jam along the extra mile.
There is no unmoving mover behind the movement. It is only movement. It is not correct to say that life is moving, but life is movement itself. Life and movement are not two different things. In other words, there is no thinker behind the thought. Thought itself is the thinker. If you remove the thought, there is no thinker to be found.
There is no way to happiness, happiness is the way.
There isnt always an explanation for everything.
There isn't an end point to excellence where you have it and you can stop. Being your best self means keeping on trying.
There is one meaning for static in C: a global variable that is invisible outside the current scope, be it a function or a file.
There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do if he chooses, and that is his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. - Mr. Knightley

There is only one religion - it is a way a man dies.
There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way.
There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.
There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
There is only one You. Dare to be yourself. Be authentic to you, and you will find your destiny. - STRONG: Powerful Philosophy for Timeless Thoughts.
There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.
There is progress whether ye are going forward or backward! The thing is to move!
There is simply no substitute for hard work when it comes to achieving success.
There is something almost shocking in the notion of so chaste a function carrying this Kantian hurlyburly in her womb.
There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.
There is something more - the spirit, or the soul. I think that that quality encourages our courtesy and care and our minds. And mercy, and identity.
There is your truth and there is my truth. As for the universal truth, it does not exist.
There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge and wisdom. Shall we instead choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? I appeal as a human being to human beings; remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
There may be some truth (atheists) do not need to believe in a god to be good, but then if they do not believe in a god, who do they believe gives the Universal Law of following good and shunning evil? Obviously, mankind. But then that is a dangerous thing, for if a man does not believe in a god capable of giving perfect laws, he is in the position of declaring all laws come from man, and as man is imperfect, he can declare that as fallible men make imperfect laws, he can pick and choose what he wishes to follow, that which, in his own mind seems good. He does not believe in divine retribution, therefore he can also declare his own morality contrary to what the divine may decree simply because he believes there is no divine decree. He may follow his every whim and passion, declaring it to be good when it may be very evil, for he like all men is imperfect, so how can he tell what is verily good? The atheist is in danger of mistaking vice for good and consequently follow another slave master and tyrant, his own physical and mental weakness. Evil would be wittingly or unwittingly perpetrated, therefore, to recognise the existence of a perfect divine being that gives perfect Universal Laws is much better than not to believe in a god, for if there is a perfect god, they will not allow their laws to be broken with impunity as in the case with many corrupt judges on earth, but will punish accordingly in due time. Therefore, to be pious and reverent is the surest path to true freedom as a perfect god will give perfect laws to prevent all manner of slavery, tyranny and moral wantonness, even if we do not understand why they are good laws at times.
There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.
There never is but one opportunity of a kind.
There on the beaches of Normandy I began to reflect on the wonders of these ordinary people whose lives were laced with the markings of greatness.

There's no one particular road that will lead you to success. I think everybody will find it differently.
There's no place like home.
There's no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love. There is only a scarcity of resolve to make it happen.
There's no secret about success. Did you ever know a successful man who didn't tell you about it?
There's no success story. Everybody's got a ghetto story. You always want to make it bigger than what it is.
There's nothing fundamentally wrong with people. Given a story to enact that puts them in accord with the world, they will live in accord with the world. But given a story to enact that puts them at odds with the world, as yours does, they will live at odds with the world. Given a story to enact in which they are the lords of the world, they will ACT like lords of the world. And, given a story to enact in which the world is a foe to be conquered, they will conquer it like a foe, and one day, inevitably, their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet, as the world is now.
There's no way you can kill someone and get to the other side of the experience unchanged.

The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same.
The road to success is always under construction.
The road to success is not easy to navigate, but with hard work, drive and passion, it's possible to achieve the American dream.
The ruinous abdication by philosophy of its rightful domain is the consequence of the oblivion of philosophers to a great insight first beheld clearly by Socrates and re-affirmed by Kant as by no other philosopher. Science, concerned solely and exclusively with objective existents, cannot give answers to questions about meanings and values. Only ideas engendered by the mind and to be found nowhere but in the mind (Socrates), only the pure transcendental forms supplied by reason (Kant), can secure the ideals and values and put us in touch with the realities that constitute our moral and spiritual life. Twenty-four centuries after Socrates, two centuries after Kant, we badly need to re-learn the lesson.
The ruling classes use broken and smashed up childhoods as weaponised instruments of domination around the world. This is why the government has no incentive to end child abuse; because the government needs abuse victims as enforcers.
The rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher.
The sacredness, if there is any, is all in yourself and not in the place.
The saddest thing that can happen to a person is to find out their memories are lies.
The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to
The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.
The same word we love and hate, leaves in different directions, taking different paths.
The satyr, as the Dionysiac chorist, dwells in a reality sanctioned by myth and ritual. That tragedy should begin with him, that the Dionysiac wisdom of tragedy should speak through him, is as puzzling a phenomenon as, more generally, the origin of tragedy from the chorus. Perhaps we can gain a starting point for this inquiry by claiming that the satyr, that fictive nature sprite, stands to cultured man in the same relation as Dionysian music does to civilization. Richard Wagner has said of the latter that it is absorbed by music as lamplight by daylight. In the same manner, I believe, the cultured Greek felt himself absorbed into the satyr chorus, and in the next development of Greek tragedy state and society, in fact everything that separates man from man, gave way before an overwhelming sense of unity that led back into the heart of nature. This metaphysical solace (which, I wish to say at once, all true tragedy sends us away) that, despite every phenomenal change, life is at bottom indestructibly joyful and powerful, was expressed most concretely in the chorus of satyrs, nature beings who dwell behind all civilization and preserve their identity through every change of generations and historical movement.
The scepticism which men affect towards their higher inspirations is often not an honest doubt, but a guilty negligence, and is a sign of narrow mind and defective wisdom.
The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.

The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.

The source of man's rights is not divine law or a congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A ___ and man is man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man's nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the product for his work. If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbids him the irrational

The spectacle is at the same time the mirage of self in the mirror of things.
The spread of evil is the symptom of a vacuum. Whenever evil wins, it is only by default: by the moral failure of those who evade the fact that there can be no compromise on basic principles.

The state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else.
The statement 'There is nothing more American than an Indian' happens to be a multidimensional paradox. Try and not say too many of those. That might open your mind to ideas that could cause sanity point loss.
The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four people is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of your three best friends. If they're okay, then it's you.
The sterile pleasure of being right tends to get stale in the course of a lifetime.
The stimulus to thought lies in the detail provided.
The stone that was rolled before Christ's tomb might appropriately be called the philosopher's stone because its removal gave not only the pharisees but, now for 1800 years, the philosophers so much to think about.
The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his efforts, but by his ordinary life.
The stronger a culture, the less it fears the radical fringe. The more paranoid and precarious a culture, the less tolerance it offers.
The strongest people aren't always the people who win, but the people who don't give up when they lose.
The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory.
The struggle ends when the gratitude begins.
The student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. He feels himself inadequate and thinks he will not understand him. But if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible than his modern commentator. The simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very great deal of what Plato said; but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on Platonism.
The Study of philosophy is not that we may know what men have thought, but what the truth of things is.
The success and the failure are not my concern, but His.

The sun symbolizes the Divine intelligence; the empty vastness of space symbolizes the Divine All-Possibility and also the Divine immutability; a bird symbolizes the soul; a tree symbolizes the grades of being; and water symbolizes knowledge and rain revelation.
The superior man makes the difficulty to be overcome his first interest; success only comes later.
The supply of matter in the universe was never more tightly packed than it is now, or more widely spread out. For nothing is ever added to it or subtracted from it. It follows that the movement of atoms today is no different from what it was in bygone ages and always will be. So the things that have regularly come into being will continue to come into being in the same manner; they will be and grow and flourish so far as each is allowed by the laws of nature.
The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.
The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.
The swallow which builds its nest on a bamboo door screen, will find it difficult to rest.
The swarm is headed towards us.
The swordsman said, "Don't you see? The point is that you can't do the right thing unless you first decide to do the right thing. One way or the other, people err. Circumstance carry them into misdeed. Without any reason, without any thought, without any intention, they find themselves having been turned astray, onto the wrong path. The opposite never happens. No one says, 'Without realizing it, I found myself doing the right thing,' or 'At some point I must have started doing good deeds,' or 'I inadvertently did something right.' Without intent, there is no being right. Proper conduct requires proper intent. Without first deciding to the right thing, you can't do it. If you say you hurt because you can't do the right thing, that's because you haven't decided what you want to do.
The symbolism of meat-eating is never neutral. To himself, the meat-eater seems to be eating life. To the vegetarian, he seems to be eating death. There is a kind of gestalt-shift between the two positions which makes it hard to change, and hard to raise questions on the matter at all without becoming embattled.
The system that enables the most people to earn the most success is free enterprise, by matching up people's skills, interests, and abilities. In contrast, redistribution simply spreads money around. Even worse, it attenuates the ability to earn success by perverting economic incentives.
The talent of success is nothing more than doing what you can do well, and doing well whatever you do without thought of fame. If it comes at all it will come because it is deserved, not because it is sought after.
The tendency in modern civilization is to make the world uniform... Let the mind be universal. The individual should not be sacrificed.
The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.
The test of courage comes when we are in the minority. The test of tolerance comes when we are in the majority.
The theistic philosopher has a tendency to devalue insufficient worldviews, ideologies, and quite often common sense for the greater good, and in such cases, one should not be discouraged when seen as a bad guy. If he stresses over man's perception of a righteous heart, then he has given his heart to man.
The Theist tells us that the truth is
The theological perspective of participation actually saves the appearances by exceeding them. It recognizes that materialism and spiritualism are false alternatives, since if there is only finite matter there is not even that, and that for phenomena really to be there they must be more than there. Hence, by appealing to an eternal source for bodies, their art, language, sexual and political union, one is not ethereally taking leave of their density. On the contrary, one is insisting that behind this density resides an even greater density -- beyond all contrasts of density and lightness (as beyond all contrasts of definition and limitlessness). This is to say that all there is only is because it is more than it is. (...)
The thermometer of success is merely the jealousy of the malcontents.
The thing about a spiral is, if you follow it inward, it never actually ends. It just keeps tightening, infinitely.

The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets successfully through many a bad night.
The thoughts of all men arise from the darkness. If you are the movement of your soul, and the cause of that movement precedes you, then how could you ever call your thoughts your own? How could you be anything other than a slave to the darkness that comes before?
The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.
The three most important words in a relationship are not, 'I love you,' but, 'Tell me more.
The three ordinary things that we often don't pay enough attention to, but which I believe are the drivers of all success, are hard work, perseverance, and basic honesty.
The time I had waited probably made the difference between success and failure.
The time is right to make a new friend.
The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: only to depend from himself, and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to embrace contentendly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came; and above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to expect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those elements, of which every creature is composed. And if the elements themselves suffer nothing by their perpetual conversion of one into another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto all, why should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But nothing that is according to nature can be evil.
The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities.
The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success.
The tragedy is that we cannot believe the dogmas of religion and metaphysics if we have the strict methods of truth in heart and head, but on the other hand, we have become through the development of humanity so tenderly suffering that we need the highest kind of means of salvation and consolation: whence arises the danger that man may bleed to death through the truth that he realises.
The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.
The tragedy of man is the difference between what he can be, and what he is.
The treacherous are ever distrustful.
The trouble in America is not that we are making too many mistakes, but that we are making too few.
The trouble is you can shut your eyes but you can't shut your mind.
The trouble is you think you have time.
The trouble was that he was talking in philosophy but they were listening in gibberish.
The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it.
The trouble with doing something right the first time, is nobody appreciates how difficult it was.
The trouble with the world is that the stupid are always cocksure and the intelligent are always filled with doubt.
The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.
The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.
The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.
The true philosopher is a man who says "All right," and goes to sleep in his armchair.
The true test of character is not how much we know how to do, but how we behave when we don't know what to do.
The truth always carries the ambiguity of the words used to express it.
The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for.
The truth is, going against the internal stream of ignorance is way more rebellious than trying to start some sort of cultural revolution.
The truth is helpless when up against perception
The truth is on the march and nothing will stop it.
The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
The truth is that relative income is not directly related to happiness. Nonpartisan social-survey data clearly show that the big driver of happiness is earned success: a person's belief that he has created value in his life or the life of others.
The turning point in the process of growing up is when you discover the core of strength within you that survives all hurt.
The turning point was when I hit my 30th birthday. I thought, if really want to write, it's time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book.
The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.
The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it.
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something.
The ultimate goal of humanity is knowledge.
The undertaking of a new action brings new strength.
The unity of scientific and spiritual knowledge is realized when each of the particular sciences is organically related to the supreme knowledge of al-tawhid.
The universe danced towards life. Life was a remarkably common commodity. Anything sufficiently complicated seemed to get cut in for some, in the same way that anything massive enough got a generous helping of gravity. The universe had a definite tendency towards awareness. This suggested a certain subtle cruelty woven into the very fabric of space-time.
The universe is a philosophical abyss.
The universe never complains.
The unknown," said Faxe's soft voice in the forest, "the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on. Ignorance is the ground of thought. Unproof is the ground of action. If it were proven that there is no God there would be no religion. No Handdara, no Yomesh, no hearthgods, nothing. But also if it were proven that there is a God, there would be no religion. ... Tell me, Genry, what is known? What is sure, unpredictable, inevitable -- the one certain thing you know concerning your future, and mine?"
The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.
The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is counter to our vanity.
The very best thing you can do for the whole world is to make the most of yourself.
The very first step towards success in any occupation is to become interested in it.
The victor belongs to the spoils.
The view that man was ever to be drawn by some vision of the unattainable shining ahead, doomed ever to aspire, but not to achieve, my life and my values could not bring me to that.
The view that the truth is one and undivided, and the same for all men everywhere at all times, whether one finds it in the pronouncements of sacred books, traditional wisdom, the authority of churches, democratic majorities, observation and experiment conducted by qualified experts, or the convictions of simple folks uncorrupted by civilisation---this view, in one form or another, is central to western thought, which stems from Plato and his disciples.
The vision that you glorify in your mind, the ideal that you enthrone in your heart - this you will build your life by, and this you will become.
The vivid force of his mind prevailed, and he fared forth far beyond the flaming ramparts of the heavens and traversed the boundless universe in thought and mind.
The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.
The warrior learns of the spiritual realm by dwelling on the cutting edge of the sword, standing at the edge of the fire pit, venturing right up to the edge of starvation if necessary. Vibrant and intense living is the warrior's form of worship.
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success.
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.
The Way Get Started Is To Quit Talking And Begin Doing.
The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.
The way of a superior man is three-fold: virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear.
The ways of fate are indeed hard to understand. If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the world is a cruel jest.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
The way to get started is to quit talking and start doing.
The way to get started is to quit talking ans begin doing.
The way you see people is the way you treat them and the way you treat them is what they become.
The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.
The wealth required by nature is limited and is easy to procure; but the wealth required by vain ideals extends to infinity.
The weeds keep multiplying in our garden, which is our mind ruled by fear. Rip them out and call them by name.
The western mind makes definitions; it draws lines.
The whole life of a man is but a point in time; let us enjoy it.
The whole secret of a successful life is to find out what is one's destiny to do, and then do it.
The will of the people, moreover, practically means the will of the most numerous or the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority; type people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this as against any other abuse of power.
The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions.
The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.
The will to succeed is important, but what's more important is the will to prepare.
The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.
The winner's edge is not in a gifted birth, a high IQ, or in talent. The winner's edge is all in the attitude, not aptitude. Attitude is the criterion for success.
The wise does at once what the fool does at last.
The wise man belongs to all countries, for the home of a great soul is the whole world.
The wise man who has become accustomed to necessities knows better how to share with others than how to take from them, so great a treasure of self-sufficiency has he found.
The wonderful and frustrating thing about understanding yourself is that nobody can do it for you.
The words 'I Love You' kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second.
The Work Begins Anew, The Hope Rises Again, And The Dream Lives On.
The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.
The work of the philosophical policeman," replied the man in blue, "is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective. The ordinary detective goes to pot-houses to arrest thieves; we go to artistic tea-parties to detect pessimists. The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed. We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed. We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime. We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartlepool, and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks (a smart young fellow) thoroughly understood a triolet.
The world does not speak. Only we do. The world can, once we have programmed ourselves with a language, cause us to hold beliefs. But it cannot propose a language for us to speak. Only other human beings can do that.
The world has become sad because a puppet was once melancholy. The nihilist, that strange martyr who has no faith, who goes to the stake without enthusiasm, and dies for what he does not believe in, is a purely literary product. He was invented by Turgenev, and completed by Dostoevsky. Robespierre came out of the pages of Rousseau as surely as the People's Palace rose out debris of a novel. Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it, but moulds it to its purpose.
The world is a garden of philosophy. God is its gardener; Man is the visitor.
The world is a good judge of things, for it is in natural ignorance, which is man's true state. The sciences have two extremes which meet. The first is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find themselves at birth. The other extreme is that reached by great intellects, who, having run through all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come back again to that same ignorance from which they set out; but this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself. Those between the two, who have departed from natural ignorance and not been able to reach the other, have some smattering of this vain knowledge and pretend to be wise. These trouble the world and are bad judges of everything. The people and the wise constitute the world; these despise it, and are despised. They judge badly of everything, and the world judges rightly of them.
The world is but a canvas to the imagination.
The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.
The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.
The world is my country, all mankind are my bethren, and to do good is my religion.
The world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless.
The world rests on principles.
The world's a puzzle; no need to make sense out of it." - Socrates
The world's people all share the earnest aspiration to have peace, stability, justice and cooperation.
The world, viewed philosophically, remains a series of slave camps, where citizens -- tax livestock -- labor under the chains of illusion in the service of their masters.
The world was floods above and fire below
The Wright brothers flew right through the smoke screen of impossibility.
They all know the truth, that there are only three subjects worth talking about. At least here in these parts," he says, "The weather, which, as they're farmers, affects everything else. Dying and birthing, of both people and animals. And what we eat - this last item comprising what we ate the day before and what we're planning to eat tomorrow. And all three of these major subjects encompass, in one way or another, philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology, the physical sciences, history, art, literature, and religion. We get around to sparring about all that counts in life but we usually do it while we're talking about food, it being a subject inseparable from every other subject. It's the table and the bed that count in life. And everything else we do, we do so we can get back to the table, back to the bed.
They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
They are never alone who are accompanied by noble thought.
They are waiting for you to light up, So that they can blow you off.
They call it a Royale with cheese.
They call me Mister Tibbs!
They can because they think they can.
They can conquer who believe they can.
They can't tell so much about you if you got your eyes closed.
They grew; they did not talk about growing.
They lived like monkeys still, while their new god powers lay around them in the weeds.
They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
They [Nazi captors]had more liberty, more options to choose from in their environment; but he [Viktor Frankl] had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options.
They're here!
They said, we have education, but what about jobs? So I started telling them, you should be taking a pledge, and the pledge should be: 'I'm not a job seeker; I'm a job giver.' Prepare yourself to be a job giver.
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think the same could be said for time.
They say that God works in mysterious ways, but what is so mysterious about love?
They succeed, because they think they can.
They talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America?
they Whatever can make life truly happy is absolutely good in its own right because it cannot be warped into evil From whence then comes error In that while all men wish for a happy life they mistake the means for the thing itself and while they fancy themselves in pursuit of it they are flying from it for when the sum of happiness consists in solid tranquillity and an unembarrassed confidence therein they are ever collecting causes of disquiet and not only carry burthens but drag them painfully along through the rugged and deceitful path of life so that they still withdraw themselves from the good effect proposed the more pains they take the more business they have upon their hands instead of advancing they are retrograde and as it happens in a labyrinth their very speed puzzles and confounds them
They will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly express that which I desire to treat of, but they do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience rather than by words. And [experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so, as mistress, I will cite her in all cases. Though I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall rely on that which is much greater and more worthy: on experience, the mistress of their masters.
The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.
Things always become obvious after the fact
Things are not always what they seem.
Things are not always what they seem; the first appearance deceives many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.
Things do not change; we change.
Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.
Things evolve into other things. Emotions do the same. Forever. Your best ally in all of these shifting seas is your faith in the fact that you are exactly where you are supposed to be. Stay put. Stay soft. Stay gentle and kind. Listen to your instincts. Meditate. Pray. Laugh as much as humanly possible. Pain is ok too. Say thank you for all of it. Feel proud that you have spent most of your life's energy on cultivating a strong connection to your own soul and the will of your heart. It is leading you somewhere deeply satisfying, but never perfect.
Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.
Things that look like an 'overnight success' typically are not.
Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.
Things which are accidentally the causes either of hope or fear are called good or evil omens.
Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.
Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work out.
Thinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that Reason, glorified for centuries, is the most obstinate adversary of thinking.
Thinking should become your capital asset, no matter whatever ups and downs you come across in your life.
Thinking: the talking of the soul with itself.
Thinking you know something is a sure way to blind yourself.
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!
Think like a man of action; act like a man of thought.
Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success.
Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.
Think of me as an impetuous Hegel, drunk with power, and also, regular drunk.
Think of what you have rather than of what you lack. Of the things you have, select the best and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them.
Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success. A whole, clear, glorious life lies before you. Achieve! Achieve!
Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another.
Think with your whole body.
Thirty-five is when you finally get your head together and your body starts falling apart.
This body is fragile. It is just flesh. Listen to the heartbeat. Life depends on the pumping of a muscle.
This causation exists as a streamed organization of constantly fluid potential. Anything that can be must first hold the streaming potential to be. It is soul.
This CD became something of a personal journey for me. The tone of the whole CD is uplifting and inspirational. It's an upper. We have enough downers in the world.
This city belongs to ghosts, to murderers, to sleepwalkers. Where are you, in what bed, in what dream?
This feat I also had no idea how to accomplish, but ignorance had never stopped me from taking action before.
This inhuman place makes human monsters.
This, in the end, is the prime purpose of a philosophy: to give us lucid ways to think about the world and how to live in it.
This intriguing 'somewhere else,' where intelligence no longer matters and awareness melts away, commands us to cherish our remains of innocence -- because of all the characteristics of human nature, the richest by far is passion for the perfectly useless.
This is considered almost holy work by farmers and ranchers. Kill off everything you can't eat. Kill off anything that eats what you eat. Kill off anything that doesn't feed what you eat."
This is just rap. I'm not trying to make people think I'm some sort of scientific wizard or inspirational poet.
This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.
This is not a book of truth, but simply a book that attempts with as little bias as humanly possible, to understand truth. In reality, there can be no book of truth, because truth does not rise from books. Truth rises from the human mind - truth rises from the deepest fathoms of your soul.
This isn't burger king, you can't have it your way.
This is precisely how someone speaks who imagines that he is the world's divinely appointed ruler: 'I will not LET them starve. I will not LET the drought come. I will not LET the river flood.
This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand. Because I don't like women in skirts and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. Then you have the pants under the skirt and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape. So I think this is the best costume for today.
This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.
This is the first test of a gentleman: his respect for those who can be of no possible value to him.
This is the Modern Man. The man who seeks himself without ever seeking, because he does not want to find;
This is the paradox of public space: even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, saying it in public changes everything. One of the first measures taken by the new Bolshevik government in 1918 was to make public the entire corpus of tsarist secret diplomacy, all the secret agreements, the secret clauses of public agreements etc. There too the target was the entire functioning of the state apparatuses of power.
This is the secret of life: the self lives only by dying, finds its identity (and its happiness) only by self-forgetfulness, self-giving, self-sacrifice, and agape love.
This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.
This is why they started us here so young: to give ourselves away before the age when the questions 'why' and 'to what' grow real beaks and claws.
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.
This is your life, and its ending one minute at a time.
This only is denied to God: the power to undo the past.
This place has only three exits, sir: Madness, and Death.
This place is a dream. Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief.
This place is special to me and I just wanted to share it with you.
This primary question of life organization is immensely important. If making money is the main goal, a person can often forget what his or her true interests are or how he or she wants to deserve recognition from others. It is much more difficult to add on other values to a life that started out with just making money in mind than it is to make some personally interesting endeavor financially possible or even profitable.
This sweet virginal primitive land will metaphorically breathe a sigh of relief --like a whisper of wind--when we are all and finally gone and the place and its creations can return to their ancient procedures unobserved and undisturbed by the busy, anxious, brooding consciousness of man.
This time, there was no escape, I could not turn away, could not leave without accepting what I had done. There was only one way to the other side, and that was through the pain.
This too, shall pass.
This world, in which reason is more and more at home, is not habitable. It is hard and cold like those depots in which are piled up goods that cannot satisfy: neither clothe those who are naked, nor feed those who are hungry; it is as impersonal as factory hangars and industrial cities in which manufactured things remain abstract, true with statistical truth and borne on the anonymous circuit of the economy, resulting from skilful planning decisions which cannot prevent, but prepare disasters. There it is, the mind in its masculine essence, living on the outside, exposed to the violent, blinding sun, to the trade winds that beat against it and beat it down, on a land without folds, rootless, solitary and wandering and thus already alienated by the very things which it caused to be produced and which remain untameable and hostile.
This year's Psychic Fair will be held on June 23rd. In the event of rain, it will be held the previous Saturday.
Thomas Jefferson, that owner of many slaves, chose to begin the Declaration of Independence by directly contradicting the moral basis of slavery, writing "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights ..." thus undercutting simultaneously any argument that Africans were racially inferior, and also that they or their ancestors could ever have been justly and legally deprived of their freedom. In doing so, however, he did not propose some radically new conception of rights and liberties. Neither have subsequent political philosophers. For the most part, we've just kept the old ones, but with the word "not" inserted here and there. Most of our most precious rights and freedoms are a series of exceptions to an overall moral and legal framework that suggests we shouldn't really have them in the first place.
Those are my principles. If you don't like them I have others.
Those were steps for me, and I have climbed up over them: to that end I had to pass over them. Yet they thought that I wanted to retire on them.
Those who are wise won't be busy, and those who are too busy can't be wise.
Those who are without compassion cannot see what is seen with the eyes of compassion.
Those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around.
Those who create children must raise them"
Those who do not think bout the future cannot have one.
Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.
Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.
Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.
Those who have succeeded at anything and don't mention luck are kidding themselves.
Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.
Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity. Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity. For the crowd believes that if it cannot see to the bottom of something it must be profound. It is so timid and dislikes going into the water.
Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.
Those who make conversations impossible, make escalation inevitable.
Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.
Those who meet Jesus always experience either joy or its opposites, either foretastes of Heaven or foretastes of Hell. Not everyone who meets Jesus is pleased, and not everyone is happy, but everyone is shocked.
Those who wish to sing, always find a song.
Though all men be equally frail before the world, the differences between them are terrifying.
Though I had success in my research both when I was mad and when I was not, eventually I felt that my work would be better respected if I thought and acted like a 'normal' person.
Thoughtfulness for others, generosity, modesty, and self-respect, are the qualities which make a real gentleman, or lady, as distinguished from the veneered article which commonly goes by that name.
Thought is so cunning, so clever, that it distorts everything for its own convenience.
Thought is the original source of all wealth, all success, all material gain, all great discoveries and inventions, and of all achievement.
Thought is the wind, knowledge the sail, and mankind the vessel.
Thought is what we start from: the simple, intimate, immediate datum. Matter is the inferred thing, the mystery.
Thought's a luxury. Do you think the peasant sits and thinks of God and Democracy when he gets inside his mud hut at night?
Thoughts become things. If you see it in your mind, you will hold it in your hand.
Thoughts lead on to purposes; purposes go forth in action; actions form habits; habits decide character; and character fixes our destiny.
Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.
Though why should we expect age to mellow us? If it isn't life's business to reward merit, why should it be life's business to give us warm, comfortable feelings towards its end? What possible evolutionary purpose could nostalgia serve?
Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.
Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle. Happiness never decreases by being shared.
Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the
Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.
Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure.
Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.
Thus I assume that to each according to his threat advantage is not a conception of justice.
Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
Thus they have an idol that they petition for victory in war; another for success in their labors; and so for everything in which they seek or desire prosperity, they have their idols, which they honor and serve.
Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;
Time (again, Time) like the soul, wears many faces, many bodies and climates and attitudes. The past is one face, the present a second and the future yet another.
Time deals gently only with those who take it gently.
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana
Time heals all wounds. Keep your chin up.

Time is a game played beautifully by children.
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
Time is just quantified eternity.
Time is life itself, and life resides in the human heart.
Time is not measured by a watch, but by moments.
Time is simply the measurement of human progression against that of existence.
Time is the Mind of Space.
Time is the most precious element of human existence. The successful person knows how to put energy into time and how to draw success from time.
Time is what keeps everything from happening all at once.
Time is what keeps things from happening all at once.
Time is what we want most, but what we use worst.
Times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the future.
Time's fun when you're having flies.
Time to stand up for what you believe in.
'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print. A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't.

To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream, not only plan, but also believe.
To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.
To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.
To all appearances he was just drifting. In actuality he was just drifting.
To approach the Other in conversation is to welcome his expression, in which at each instant he overflows the idea a thought would carry away from it. It is therefore to receive from the Other beyond the capacity of the I, which means exactly: to have the idea of infinity. But this also means: to be taught. The relation with the Other, or Conversation, is a non-allergic relation, an ethical relation; but inasmuch as it is welcomed this conversation is a teaching. Teaching is not reducible to maieutics; it comes from the exterior and brings me more than I contain. In its non-violent transitivity the very epiphany of the face is produced.
To assess the quality of thoughts of people, don't listen to their words, but watch their actions.
To be a god can ultimately become boring and degrading. There'd be reason enough for the invention of free will! A god might wish to escape into sleep and be alive only in the unconscious projections of his dream-creatures.
To be a good loser is to learn how to win.
To be alone is to be different, to be different is to be alone.
To be a man requires that you accept everything life has to give you, beginning with your name.
To be an artist is to believe in life.
To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity and trust.
To be a philosopher, just reverse everything you have ever been told...and have a sense of humor doing it.
To be a poet is a vacation not a vocation.
To bear defeat with dignity, to accept criticism with poise, to receive honors with humility -- these are marks of maturity and graciousness.
To bear trials with a calm mind robs misfortune of its strength and burden.
To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.
To be a success, look at the failure and see the light of success.
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to be yourself.
To become truly great, one has to stand with people, not above them.
To be evenminded
To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.
To begin, begin.
To be good is noble, but to teach others how to be good is nobler--and less trouble.
To be incapable of taking one's enemies, one's accidents, even one's misdeeds seriously for very long - that is the sign of strong full natures in whom there is an excess of power to form, to mold, to recuperate and to forget. Mirabeau had no memory for insults and vile actions done to him and was unable to forgive simply because he - forgot. Such a man shakes off with a single shrug the many vermin that eat deep into others.
To believe in nothing is as ridiculous as to believe in everything. Reason and factual evidence may convert a belief into knowledge.
To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.
To be, or not to be: what a question!
To be pleasant, gentle, calm and self-possessed: this is the basis of good taste and charm in a woman. No matter how amorous or passionate you may be, as long as you are straightforward and refrain from causing others embarrassment, no one will mind. But women who are too vain and act pretentiously, to the extent that they make others feel uncomfortable, will themselves become the object of attention; and once that happens, people will find fault with whatever they say or do; whether it be how they enter a room, how they sit down, how they stand up or how they take their leave. Those who end up contradicting themselves and those who disparage their companions are also carefully watched and listened to all the more. As long as you are free from such faults, people will surely refrain from listening to tittle-tattle and will want to show you sympathy, if only for the sake of politeness.
To be poor, ugly and, moreover, intelligent condemns one in our society to a dark and disillusioned life...to beauty all is forgiven.
To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.
To be prepared is half the victory.

To be successful you must accept all challenges that come your way. You can't just accept the ones you like.
To better understand God we must first shatter our own idea of God - maybe even day after day. Maybe he's too great to stay compressed in the human mind. Maybe he splits it wide open; this is why pretentious intellectualism so often fails to comprehend the concept of God: it is only accepting of what it can explain while in the process finding higher sources offensive. What we may confidently assert is that faith is the opening that allows God, this unpredictable, unseen power, to travel in and out of the mind without all the pains of confusion.
To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
To be yourself is in many ways to be inconvenient to others. Only placaters and appeasers get along with other people all the time and that's not really getting along with anyone. That's just self erasure.

To change one's life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly. No exceptions.

Today a reader, tomorrow a leader.
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Heres Tom with the Weather.

Today is not the day I die.
Today is the only day. Yesterday is gone.
Today, more than ever before, life must be characterized by a sense of Universal responsibility, not only nation to nation and human to human, but also human to other forms of life.

To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them.
To infinity and beyond!
To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
To keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits in the presence of fate is strength undefeatable.
To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.
To know oneself, one should assert oneself.

Tolerance and celebration of individual differences is the fire that fuels lasting love.
Tolerance is only complacence when it makes no distinction between right and wrong.
To level the playing field, I keep a little devil inside of me, but I show god to the world.
To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude.
To live a life without success is insignificant. To live a life without loving others is miserable.
To live alone one must be a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out the third case: one must be both--a philosopher.
To live entirely without a goal! I have glimpsed this state, and have often attained it, without managing to remain there: I am too weak for such happiness.
To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.
To live in any true sense of the word is to reject others; to accept them, one must be able to renounce, to do oneself violence, to act against one's own nature, to weaken oneself; we conceive freedom only for ourselves - we extend it to our neighbours only at the cost of exhausting efforts; whence the precariousness of liberalism, a defiance of our instincts, a brief and miraculous success, a state of exception, at the antipodes of our deepest imperatives.
To live is not to breathe but to act. It is to make use of our organs, our senses, our faculties, of all the parts of ourselves which give us the sentiment of our existence. The man who has lived the most is not he who has counted the most years but he who has most felt life.
To live is to change, to acquire the words of a story, and that is the only celebration we mortals really know.
To lose a brother is to lose someone with whom you can share the experience of growing old, who is supposed to bring you a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews, creatures who people the tree of your life and give it new branches. To lose your father is to lose the one whose guidance and help you seek, who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches. To lose your mother, well, that is like losing the sun above you. It is like losing--I'm sorry, I would rather not go on.
To love and be loved is like feeling the sun from both sides.
To love is good, too: love being difficult. For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation...Love is a high inducement to the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world for himself for another's sake, it is a great exacting claim upon him, something that chooses him out and calls him to vast things.
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
To lovers there.
To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.
To meet at all, one must open ones eyes to another; and there is no true conversation no matter how many words are spoken, unless the eye, unveiled and listening, opens itself to the other.
To me, the Seventies were very inspirational and very influential... With my whole persona as Snoop Dogg, as a person, as a rapper. I just love the Seventies style, the way all the players dressed nice, you know, kept their hair looking good, drove sharp cars and they talked real slick.
Tom felt his darkness. His father was beautiful and clever, his mother was short and mathematically sure. Each of his brothers and sisters had looks or gifts or fortune. Tom loved all of them passionately, but he felt heavy and earth-bound. He climbed ecstatic mountains and floundered in the rocky darkness between the peaks. He had spurts of bravery but they were bracketed in battens of cowardice.
Tomorrow do thy worst, I have lived today.
Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday.
Tomorrow's a good day for dying.
Too lazy to be ambitious,
Too low they build, who build beneath the stars.
Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.
Too many people get credit for being good, when they are only being passive. They are too often praised for being broadminded when they are so broadminded they can never make up their minds about anything.
Too many people measure how successful they are by how much money they make or the people that they associate with. In my opinion, true success should be measured by how happy you are.
Too often children are treated as tradeable commodities in relationships"
Too often, contemporary continental philosophers take the "other" of philosophy to mean literature, but not religion, which is for them just a little too wholly other, a little beyond their much heralded tolerance of alterity. They retain an antagonism to religious texts inherited straight from the Enlightenment, even though they pride themselves on having made the axioms and dogmas of the Enlightenment questionable. But the truth is that contemporary continental philosophy is marked by the language of the call and the response, of the gift, of hospitality to the other, of the widow, the orphan and the stranger, and by the very idea of the "wholly other," a discourse that any with the ears to hear knows has a Scriptural provenance and a Scriptural resonance. ("A Prologue",
To pursue wisdom is to live in such a way that one is prepared to face death when it comes. (247)
To question reason is to trust it.
To recognize untruth as a condition of life--that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil.
To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness of heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.
To ridicule philosophy is really to philosophize.
To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour--who can do this conjuring trick so well as women?
To See What Is Right And Not Do It Is A Lack Of Courage.
To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.

To sum it all up, the [Ayn] Rand belief system looks like this:
To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing oneself.
To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study it.
To the extent that in one's act of faith one participates in the truth through reason and heart, faith already implies a particular level of knowledge and of certainty.
To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.
To theology, ... only what it holds sacred is true, whereas to philosophy, only what holds true is sacred.
To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
To these ideals which were instilled in me when I was a youth, I attribute in a large degree the success that was mine on the bicycle tracks of the world.
TO the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist much, obey little,
To the untutored sage, the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils, moral no less than physical. He argued that food is good, while surfeit kills; that love is good, but lust destroys; and not less dreaded than the pestilence following upon crowded and unsanitary dwellings was the loss of spiritual power inseparable from too close contact with one's fellow-men.
To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.
To this day, just always treat people the way you want to be treated. Whether it's family or friends or co-workers, I think it's the most important thing. Whether you have success or don't have it, whether you're a good person is all that matters.
Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
To touch the shores of humanity, become the waves of love.
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.
Tough times never last, but tough people do.
Tourism, human circulation considered as consumption is fundamentally nothing more than the leisure of going to see what has become banal.
To venture into all sorts of situations in which one may not have any sham virtues, where, like the tightrope walker on his rope, one either stands or falls--or gets away.
To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame--and something precious.
To win true freeedom you must be a slave to philosophy.
To write well, express yourself like the common people, but think like a wise man.
Training research shows that if you get speed now you can get quality later. But if you don't get speed you will never get quality in the long run.
Traveling around the country, meeting fans and hearing their stories in person and on my radio show has reenergized my commitment to creating honest and inspirational content that not only serves my own creative purposes but can help and touch others as well.
Travel is never a matter of money but of courage
Treat everyone you meet as if they were you.
Treat failure as a lesson on how not to approach achieving a goal, and then use that learning to improve your chances of success when you try again. Failure is only the end if you decide to stop.
Treat the other man's faith gently; it is all he has to believe with.
Treaty with Tripoli, Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;
Trebuie sa te departezi putin de tine ca sa te poti apropia de ceilalti.
True beauty is measured by the number of pearls within you, not those around your neck.
True good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.
True happiness involves the full use of one's power and talents.
True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one's self; but the point is not only to get out - you must stay out; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand.
True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.
True leaders don't invest in buildings. Jesus never built a building. They invest in people. Why? Because success without a successor is failure. So your legacy should not be in buildings, programs, or projects; your legacy must be in people.
True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well.
True, life is complex. But so are a great many accidents.
True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few have seen.
True love is only found in the heart.
True luck consists not in holding the best of the cards at the table; luckiest is he who knows just when to rise and go home.
True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness: 'I am life that wants to live, in the midst of life that wants to live
True religion is real living; living with all one's soul, with all one's goodness and righteousness.
True success is overcoming the fear of being unsuccessful.
True success, true happiness lies in freedom and fulfillment.
Trust because you are willing to accept the risk, not because it's safe or certain.
Trust everybody, but cut the cards.
Trust in what you love, continue to do it, and it will take you where you need to go.
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.
Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.
Truth becomes untruth if uttered by your enemy.
Truth has nothing to do with the conclusion, and everything to do with the methodology.
Truth is an illusionary ideal, a structure with a foundation of opinion, garnished by selected facts, eroded over time and rebuilt new every generation.
Truth is, do you know what is true? Or do you just believe without questioning the validity?
Truth is neither ojectivity nor the balanced view; truth is a selfless subjectivity.
Truth is not as pompous and romantic as myth ... but it has the immeasurable value of being the Truth.
Truth may start out timid, but it finishes bold.
Truth never died, False never born.
Truth, says instrumentalism, is what works out, that which does what you expect it to do. The judgment is true when you can "bank" on it and not be disappointed. If, when you predict, or when you follow the lead of your idea or plan, it brings you to the ends sought for in the beginning, your judgment is true. It does not consist in agreement of ideas, or the agreement of ideas with an outside reality; neither is it an eternal something which always is, but it is a name given to ways of thinking which get the thinker where he started. As a railroad ticket is a "true" one when it lands the passenger at the station he sought, so is an idea "true," not when it agrees with something outside, but when it gets the thinker successfully to the end of his intellectual journey.
Truth would quickly cease to be stranger than fiction, once we got as used to it.
Try a new system or a different approach.
Try for once to justify the meaning of your existence as it were a posteriori by setting yourself an aim, a goal... an exalted and noble 'to this end.' Perish in pursuit of this and only this

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do, so throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails.  Explore, Dream, Discover.
Two important decisions shall be made by you soon.
Two people should stay together if together they are better people than they would be individually.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, a little wine, good food and companionship. She goes Mondays, I go Fridays.
Typically, if you reward something, you get more of it. You punish something, you get less of it. And our businesses have been built for the last 150 years very much on that kind of motivational scheme.
Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine.
Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.
Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil.
Underneath the skin, all humanity are brothers and I would gladly skin humanity alive to prove it.

Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.
Understanding why C++ is the way it is helps a programmer use it well. A deep understanding of a tool is essential for an expert craftsman.

Une philosophie doit etre portative.
Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgement, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions against their own fallibility.
Unfortunately, religion often works to shrink and tame the very wild and mysterious forces that first drew our wonder. In the process of making the inexplicable safe for the masses, the possibilities for real illusion-piercing insight becomes reduced. One might say that they are only available to those who dare to ride the breaking crest of direct life-altering experience.
Unheard of means it's only undreamed of yet; Impossible means it's just not yet done.
Unity is a great thing and a great slogan. But what the workers' cause needs is the unity of Marxists, not unity between Marxists, and opponents and distorters of Marxism.
Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes... but no plans.

Untamable is my mind, like a bee.
Until an hour before the Devil fell, God thought him beautiful in Heaven.
Until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,-Wait and hope.
Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.
Until you make peace with who you are, you will never be content with what you have.
Until you stop breathing, there's more right with you than wrong with you.
Until you value yourself you will not value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it.

Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.
Use your voice to sing the song of love. Use your heart to understand the desires of the universe. Use your eyes to see the beauty of life.
Using your talent, hobby or profession in a way that makes you contribute with something good to this world is truly the way to go.
Usually when people talk about the trickle-down theory, it has to do with economics. The richer people at the top of a society become, supposedly, the more wealth there is to trickle down to the people below. It never really works out that way, of course, because if there are 2 things people at the top can't stand, they have to be leakage and overflow.
Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,
Veel van wat aanvankelijk alleen in de verbeelding bestaat, wordt werkelijkheid.
'Veni, Vidi, Velcro' - I came, I saw, I stuck around.
'Veni, Vidi, Visa'. I came. I Saw. I did a little shopping.
Versatility is one of your outstanding traits.
Victoria's Secret is not so much of a secret, but rather about a woman feeling feminine.
Victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan.
Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.
Violence begins with the fork.
Violence is spiritual junk food, and boredom is spiritual anorexia.
Virtue comes through contemplation of the divine, and the exercise of philosophy. But it also comes through public service. The one is incomplete without the other. Power without wisdom is tyranny; wisdom without power is pointless.
Visible objects therefore do not perish utterly, since nature repairs one thing from another and allows nothing to be born without the aid of another's death.
Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.
Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.
Visualize this thing that you want, see it, feel it, believe in it. Make your mental blue print, and begin to build.
Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.
Vulnerability may seem like a weakness, but in truth, it is a strength for being able to show you can be vulnerable, shows you are just human. And being just human is our strength. - STRONG: Powerful Philosophies for Timeless Thoughts.

Wal-Mart's success strategies and tactics are easy to understand yet hard to duplicate.
Want less, live more
War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it.
War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
War is thus divine in itself, since it is a law of the world. War is divine through its consequences of a supernatural nature which are as much general as particular. War is divine in the mysterious glory that surrounds it and in the no less inexplicable attraction that draws us to it. War is divine by the manner in which it breaks out.
War means fighting. The business of the soldier is to fight. Armies are not called out to dig trenches, to throw up breastworks, to live in camps, but to find the enemy and strike him; to invade his country, and do him all possible damage in the shortest possible time. This will involve great destruction of life and property while it lasts; but such a war will of necessity be of brief continuance, and so would be an economy of life and property in the end.
Was I insane? Maybe. But then, there were many different kinds of insanity. Aunt Rose had always taken for granted that the whole world was in a state of constantly fluctuating madness, and that a neurosis was not an illness, but a fact of life, like pimples. Some have more, some have less, but only truly abnormal people have none at all. This commonsense philosophy had consoled me many times before, and it did now, too.
Watches are the only jewelry men can wear, unless you're Mr. T.
Watch out for owls.
Watch out for the moon.
Water continually dropping will wear hard rocks hollow.
Water everywhere, falling in thundering cataracts, singular drops, and draping sheets. Kellhus paused next to one of the shining braziers, peered beneath the bronze visage that loomed orange and scowling over his father, watched him lean back into absolute shadow.
Wax on, wax off.
We aim above the mark to hit the mark.
We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus relax ourselves away from our fellows.
We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort.
We all have problems. The way we solve them is what makes us different.
We all learn lessons in life. Some stick, some don't. I have always learned more from rejection and failure than from acceptance and success.
We all live in the same world, but we experience and live undoubtedly different lives.
We all obviously need others to look up to, and be inspirational to us. Ford did a great job as far as putting the presidency back where it belonged, getting the trust back after Nixon. And President Reagan has been one of the most influential presidents.
We all of us complain of the shortness of time, saith Seneca, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives, says he, are spent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do: we are always complaining our days are few, and acting as though there would no end of them."- On the Right Use of Time
We all reach a point that is the limit of our understanding. When we stare over the precipice of uncertainty and into the dark unknown that we cannot explain with hard evidence, that is when we trade understanding for belief. At best, we make an educated guess. At worst, we make blind leaps of faith.
We all romanticize the people we adore.
We are addicted to our thoughts. We cannot change anything if we cannot change our thinking.
We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.
We are all broken, that's how the light gets in.
We are all dying to give our lives away to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately (...) To games or needles, to some other person.
We are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible situations.
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
We are all in the same boat in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a terrible loyalty.
We are all inventors, each sailing out on a voyage of discovery, guided each by a private chart, of which there is no duplicate. The world is all gates, all opportunities.
We are all unique in our minds in varied ways. I find pleasure In nature as you find it in alcohol. How then shall I call the other an addict while I myself I am a nature junkie?
We are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later.
We are born and we die. No one cares, no one remembers, and it doesn't matter. This is why we laugh.
We are born into this world unarmed - our mind is our only weapon.
We are citizens of the world. The tragedy of our times is that we do not know this.
We are constantly emphasizing to people that they need to address anything that affects flight safety or mission success - many pathways to do that. We need to understand better what may be preventing people from using those pathways.
We are creators, and yet we naively play the role of "the created." We see ourselves as helpless sheep buffeted around by the God who made us. We kneel like frightened children, begging for help, for forgiveness, for good luck. But once we realize that we are truly created in the Creator's image, we will start to understand that we, too, must be Creators. When we understand this fact, the doors will burst wide open for human potential.
We are each gifted in a unique and important way. It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light.
we are finite, in that we are a product and source of the infinite.
We are forever one.
We are here and it is now. The way I see it is, after that, everything tends towards guesswork.
We are here to make another world.
We are limited, not by our abilities, but by our vision.
We are living in the era of premeditation and the perfect crime. Our criminals are no longer helpless children who could plead love as their excuse. On the contrary, they are adults and the have the perfect alibi: philosophy, which can be used for any purpose - even for transforming murderers into judges.
We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin.
We are never at ease because our minds are always at attention.
We are not our own light.
We are not what we are, nor do we treat or esteem each other for such, but for what we are capable of being.
We are often taught to look for the beauty in all things, so in finding it, the layman asks the philosopher while the philosopher asks the photographer.
We are seeds as well as parasites to the earth. We can either give or take, depending on our perception of growth.
We are supposed to call poison medicine and we wonder why we're always sick.
We are taught to consume. And that's what we do. But if we realized that there really is no reason to consume, that it's just a mind set, that it's just an addiction, then we wouldn't be out there stepping on people's hands climbing the corporate ladder of success.
We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.
We are the hollow men
We are the inheritors of a wonderful world, a beautiful world, full of life and mystery, goodness and pain. But likewise are we the children of an indifferent universe. We break our own hearts imposing our moral order on what is, by nature, a wide web of chaos.
We are the lucky ones for we shall die, as there is an infinite number of possible forms of DNA all but a few billions of which will never burst into consciousness.
We are the sum of all people we have ever met; you change the tribe and the tribe changes you.
We are the sum of our behaviours; excellence therefore is not an act but a habit.
We are the sum total of the decisions we have made.
We are what we believe we are.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
Weariness that wants to reach the ultimate with one leap, with one fatal leap, a poor ignorant weariness that does not want to want any more: this created all gods and afterworlds.
We ask ourselves: Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.
Weather is a purely personal matter. There is no such thing as a climate that is cold or hot, good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. People take it upon themselves to create a fantasy in their imagination and call it weather. There's only one climate in the world, but the message that nature sends is interpreted according to strictly personal, non-transferable rules.
We attribute to ourselves qualities that we do not possess because if we possessed them, our lives would exactly mirror our image of ourselves. Our lies about what is really happening in our lives are what we use to "patch up" our ego with rationalizations and justifications, all of which conceal from us the fact that we cannot really do anything because we have no Being.
We awaken by asking the right questions. We awaken when we see knowledge being spread that goes against our own personal experiences. We awaken when we see popular opinion being wrong but accepted as being right, and what is right being pushed as being wrong. We awaken by seeking answers in corners that are not popular. And we awaken by turning on the light inside when everything outside feels dark.
We become philosophical when our inherited understanding can no longer account for our experience and we are forced to create for ourselves an authentic understanding capable of giving meaning to our experience.
We become so absorbed in our flaws and faults that we forget that it is better to be a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without. To have flaws is beauty in itself, a fact so frightening that we hurry to hide them from sight and tarnish the whole in the process of comparing ourselves to others.
We become what we think about.
We become what we think about most of the time, and that's the strangest secret.
We belittle what we cannot bear. We make figments out of fundamentals, all in the name of preserving our own peculiar fancies. The best way to secure one's own deception is to accuse others of deceit.
We came with nothing so we have nothing to lose. We have enough time to feel, experience, and enjoy.
We can change our destiny only by changing our thoughts.
We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish.
We can come to look upon the deaths of our enemies with as much regret as we feel for those of our friends, namely, when we miss their existence as witnesses to our success.
We can do no great things - only small things with great love.
We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.
We can never get a re-creation of community and heal our society without giving our citizens a sense of belonging.
We can never, never describe all the features of the total situation, not only because every situation is infinitely complex, but also because the total situation is the universe.
We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.
We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails.
We cannot listen to one voice above all others. We must listen to a choir of voices if we are to understand the individual tunes.
We cannot see our reflection in running water. It is only in still water that we can.
We can speak and think only of what exists. And what exists is uncreated and imperishable for it is whole and unchanging and complete. It was not or nor shall be different since it is now, all at once, one and continuous.
We can't avoid reasoning; we can only avoid doing it well.
We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone.
We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
We chart delusions through collective agreement.
We co-create our reality with others in unseen ways.
We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
We convince by our presence.
We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box.
We crave instant success these days. If you are a really good sprinter and long jumper, you don't want to spend two or three years on a whole new set of events. You're used to doing well and it's difficult to give that up.
we deceive ourselves in thinking that death only follows life whereas it both goes before and will follow after it for where is the difference in not beginning or ceasing to exist the effect of both is not to be
We did all the tourist crap, but I just wanted to sit in a cafe and watch people
We do have the brain capacity to be novel and loving souls - we are souls with limitless potential for good, yet we keep saying, it's practically impossible to be limitlessly good - to love someone infinitely - to care for someone beyond conditions.
We do not admire the man of timid peace. We admire the man who embodies victorious effort; the man who never wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend, but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life.
We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work.
We do not create life, we create death.
We do not realise that we are children of eternity. If we did, then success would be no success, and failure would be no failure to us.
We do not remember days; we remember moments.
We don't have a divine right to success. So I agree with a lot of politicians out there when they say, 'We've got serious issues.' We do: immigration, infrastructure. I think income inequality's one of them.
We don't know all the truth! We only know all the lies!
We don't like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.
We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.
We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.
We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.
We each have within ourselves the ability to shape our own destinies. That much we understand. But, more important, each of us has an equal ability to shape the destiny of the universe. Ah, that you find more difficult to believe. But I tell you it is so. You do not have to be the leader of the Council. You do not have to be king or monarch or the head of a clan to have a significant impact on the world around you.
We fall forward to succeed.
We feel most alive when we are closest to death.
We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all.
We find meaning of life not in splendor, we find it when we get lost in each other.
We follow the ways of wolves, the habits of tigers: or, rather we are worse than they. To them nature has assigned that they should be thus fed, while God has honoured us with rational speech and a sense of equity. And yet we are become worse than the wild beast.
We forget that every good that is worth possessing must be paid for in strokes of daily effort. We postpone and postpone, until those smiling possibilities are dead.
We Generate Fears While We Sit. We Overcome Them By Action.
We grown-up people think that we appreciate music, but if we realized the sense that an infant has brought with it of appreciating sound and rhythm, we would never boast of knowing music. The infant is music itself.
We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.
We have come from God, and inevitably the myths woven by us, though they contain error, will also reflect a splintered fragment of the true light, the eternal truth that is with God. Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil.
We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.
We have enough youth, how about a fountain of Smart?
We have it in our power to begin the world over again.
We have it in our power to change the world over.
We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.
We have the finest politicians that money can buy.
We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be.
We help people to begin truly healthful diets, and it is absolutely wonderful to see, not only their success, but also their delight at their ability to break old habits and feel really healthy for a change.
We hold the future still timidly, but perceive it for the first time as a function of our own action.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We in our age are faced with a strange paradox. Never before have we had so much information in bits and pieces flooded upon us by radio and television and satellite, yet never before have we had so little inner certainty about our own being. The more objective truth increases, the more our inner certitude decreases. Our fantastically increased technical power, and each forward step in technology is experienced by many as a new push toward our possible annihilation. Nietzsche was strangely prophetic when he said,
We join spokes together in a wheel,
We just don't make and sell food.
We just want to win. That's the bottom line. I think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success, but we don't really reflect on what we've done in the past. We focus on the present.
We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.
We kill, kill, kill. Flesh, spirit, whatever gets in our way. It's like our whole purpose is to extinguish life. And for those who live, there's memory, like a curse. We're such a mixture of frailty and cruelty.
We know from research that growth is actually contagious, so if you want to reach your goals, you've got to get around people that are going in the same direction you want to be going, and you will catch the success.
We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.
We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.
We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.
We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success; we often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never make a mistake never made a discovery.
We live in a stocking which is in the process of being turned inside out, without our ever knowing for sure to what phase of the process our moment of consciousness corresponds.
We live in a world of constant juxtaposition between joy that's possible and pain that's all too common. We hope for love and success and abundance, but we never quite forget that there is always lurking the possibility of disaster.
We live in deeds not years In thoughts not breaths In feelings not figures on a dial. We should count time by heart throbs. He most lives who thinks most, feels noblest, acts the best.
We live in the kind of society where, in almost all cases, hard work is rewarded.
We live such tangled, fraught lives, he thought, but in the end we die like all the other animals and we're buried in the ground and after a few years we might as well not have existed.
We'll always have Paris.
Well, certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within 'black community' by and large.
Well done is better than well said.
Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.
Well I think any author or musician is anxious to have legitimate sales of their products, partly so they're rewarded for their success, partly so they can go on and do new things.
Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing, you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
Well, the idea is that failure is an inevitable partner on the road to success and, if you're not willing to confront failure, you can never find out how good you are.
Well, you would have to say what is the criteria to determine the success of any merger? It would have to be that the companies are stronger financially, that they took market share, and they are on a very steady footing in terms of their performance.
We look for the Secret - the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of the Wise, Supreme Enlightenment, 'God' or whatever...and all the time it is carrying us about...It is the human nervous system itself.
We love ourselves notwithstanding our faults, and we ought to love our friends in like manner.
We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.
We make versions, and true versions make worlds.
We may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one.
We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
We may not yet know the right way to go, but we should at least stop going in the wrong direction.
We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.
We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.
We must balance conspicuous consumption with conscious capitalism.
We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.
We must be very careful when we give advice to younger people: sometimes they follow it!
We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
We must have a new mythology, but it must place itself at the service of ideas, it must become a mythology of reason. Mythology must become philosophical, so that the people may become rational, and philosophy must become mythological, so that philosophers may become sensible. If we do not give ideas a form that is aesthetic, i.e., mythological, they will hold no interest for people.
We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.
We must never be afraid to go too far, for success lies just beyond.
We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee.
We must think beyond ourselves
We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal, and then leap in the dark to our success.
We need to accept that the commandments of God aren't just a long list of good ideas. They aren't 'life hacks' from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board.
We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success.
We need to walk to know sacred places, those around us and those within. We need to walk to remember the songs.
We never realize just how many other lives we can help when their paths cross our own.
We never really do anything except talk about what we do.
We ought to walk through the rooms of our lives not looking for flaws, but looking for potential.
We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt, that peace and abundance may manifest for all.
We played for about half an hour before I realized we were actually playing two different games. What I'd thought of as ludo was actually a game called gin rummy, and what Warren was playing seemed to be a mixture of craps and table tennis. Once we started playing by one consistent set of rules, though, the fun was really over.
We reached a high point in my opinion with the passage of the civil rights legislation and Martin Luther King's success and the crusade of others. I think we kind of breathed a sigh of relief as if we had achieved the end of racial discrimination or white supremacy.
Were a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of forming any just opinion; everything about him would seem a chaos: he would have even his own history to ask from every one; and by not knowing how the world went in his absence, he would be at a loss to know how it ought to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it again. In like manner, though in a less degree, a too great inattention to past occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in everything; while, on the contrary, by comparing what is past with what is present, we frequently hit on the true character of both, and become wise with very little trouble.
We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.
We're built of contradictions, all of us. It's those opposing forces that give us strength, like an arch, each block pressing the next. Give me a man whose parts are all aligned in agreement and I'll show you madness. We walk a narrow path, insanity to each side. A man without contradictions to balance him will soon veer off.
We're constantly striving for success, fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about.
We're here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.
We're in a situation where talented, motivated school leavers and graduates can send off a hundred CVs and not get a reply, and where a trip to the Job Centre is depressing rather than inspirational. And you know what, that just feels wrong.
Were it not for hope the heart would break.
We relish news of our heroes, forgetting that we are extraordinary to somebody too.
We remember what we learn when we care about performing better and when we believe that what we have been asked to do is representative of reality.
We're not afraid of risking what was our success yesterday in order to explore some new field. We're adventurous. We like the challenge of unknown territory, unknown artistic field, and that's what stimulates us.
We're on a planet, relax!
...we're told by TV and Reader's Digest that a crisis will trigger massive personal change--and that those big changes will make the pain worthwhile. But from what he could see, big change almost never happens. People simply feel lost. They have no idea what to say or do or feel or think. they become messes and tend to remain messes.
Were we incapable of empathy -- of putting ourselves in the position of others and seeing that their suffering is like our own -- then ethical reasoning would lead nowhere. If emotion without reason is blind, then reason without emotion is impotent.
We rise by lifting others.
We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce that designs that assemble long lists of features.
We seem to inhabit a universe made up of a small number of elements-particles-bits that swirl in chaotic clouds, occasionally clustering together in geometrically logical temporary configurations.
We shall find peace. We shall hear angels. We shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it - and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
We should forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged
We should measure welfare's success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many are added.
We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
We shouldn't teach great books; we should teach a love of reading.
We sing inspirational songs, songs of praise and worship, and about how good and how big God is. We are magnifying the Lord.
We sinned for no reason but an incomprehensible lack of love, and He saved us for no reason but an incomprehensible excess of love.
We...sin not because we want what is evil, but because we want what isn't good enough.
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.
We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate causes of failure.
We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.
We've had great successes, but our future is not about our past success. It's going to be about whether we will invent things that are really going to drive our future.
We've removed the ceiling above our dreams. There are no more impossible dreams.
We've stayed really normal and down to Earth I think, and haven't let the success thing go to our head.
We were all born with a certain degree of power. The key to success is discovering this innate power and using it daily to deal with whatever challenges come our way.
We were taught to respect everyone, especially those who were older and wiser than we were from whom we could learn.
We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0.
We would often be sorry if our wishes came true.
We youths say "like" all the time because we mistrust reality.
What
What about you, Snipes?" Dunbar asked. "You think there to be mountain lions up here or is it just folks' imaginings?"
What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal.
What a lover's heart knows let no man's brain dispute.
What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent decreases,--when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.
What are we doing to each other? Because I know that I am doing to him exactly what he is doing to me. We are sometimes so happy, and never in our lives have we known more unhappiness.
What a silly thing love is!' said the student as he walked away. 'It is not half as useful as logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics.'
What a waste my life would be without all the beautiful mistakes I've made.
What can oppose the decline of the west is not a resurrected culture but the utopia that is silently contained in the image of its decline.
What comes, is called.
What does it matter if I remain right. I am much too right. And he who laughs best today will also laugh last.
What does it matter where my body happens to be?' he said. 'My mind goes on working all the same.
What do the French do with the rest of the frog?
What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?
What drew me towards team sport were the camaraderie and friendship. The chance to celebrate victory and success with a group of other people is something I have enjoyed doing.
What drives success, and the most successful students, is internal motivation.
What ever beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity.
Whatever I learned,
Whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
Whatever it is you're seeking won't come in the form you're expecting.
Whatever obstacle comes your way, you gotta be prepared to jump over it! And I think that's what separates the legends from the regular artists. It's all in how you manage that success, and how you deal with the controversy when it actually comes.
Whatever one man does, it is as if all men did it. For that reason, it is not unfair that one disobedience in a garden should contaminate all humanity; for that reason it is not unjust that the crucifixion of a single Jew should be sufficient to save it.
Whatever ought to be, can be.
Whatever success I may have attained is due to the fact that since I was old enough to work at all, my ambition has never deserted me.
Whatever success I've had, I always like to top it.
Whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek a noble vision of man's nature and of life's potential.
Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it.
Whatever you are, be a good one.
Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.  Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.
Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.
Whatever you do to gain success, you have to hang in there and hope good things happen. Always think positive.
Whatever you fight, you strengthen, and what you resist, persists.
Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon... must inevitably come to pass!
Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too. Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it.
What first we find impossible, we later deem unlikely, and eventually accept as inevitable.
What fools are those who spend their time constructing defenses against things there are no defenses for.
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories.
What great philosophers do for us is not to hand out such an all-purpose system. It is to light up and clarify some special aspect of life, to supply conceptual tools which will do a certain necessary kind of work. Wide though that area of work may be, it is never the whole, and all ideas lose their proper power when they are used out of their appropriate context. That is why one great philosopher does not necessarily displace another, why there is room for all of them and a great many more whom we do not have yet.
What great thing would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?
What if, at this very moment, you are living up to your full potential?
What if nobody showed up at Armageddon?
What if one were to want to hunt for these hidden presences? You can't just rummage around like you're at a yard sale. You have to listen. You have to pay attention. There are certain things you can't look at directly. You need to trick them into revealing themselves. That's what we're doing with Walter, Jaz. We're juxtaposing things, listening for echoes. It's not some silly cybernetic dream of command and control, modeling the whole world so you can predict the outcome. It's certainly not a theory of everything. I don't have a theory of any kind. What I have is far more profound.'
What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.
What I have in common with the character in 'Truman' is this incredible need to please people. I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started.
What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
What is a committee? A group of the unwilling, picked from the unfit, to do the unnecessary.
What is called genius is the abundance of life and health.
What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first step to something better.
What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.
What is existence for but to be laughed at if men in their twenties have already attained the utmost?
What is food to one man is bitter poison to others
What is harder than rock, or softer than water? Yet soft water hollows out hard rock. Persevere.
What is humor?' one of their professors had posed, and he had answered, ''nondangerous, unexpectedly inappropriate juxtaposition.
What is in mind is a sort of Chautauqua...that's the only name I can think of for it...like the traveling tent-show Chautauquas that used to move across America, this America, the one that we are now in, an old-time series of popular talks intended to edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and enlightenment to the ears and thoughts of the hearer. The Chautauquas were pushed aside by faster-paced radio, movies and TV, and it seems to me the change was not entirely an improvement. Perhaps because of these changes the stream of national consciousness moves faster now, and is broader, but it seems to run less deep. The old channels cannot contain it and in its search for new ones there seems to be growing havoc and destruction along its banks. In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels of consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that have become silted in with the debris of thoughts grown stale and platitudes too often repeated. "What's new?" is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively, results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to be concerned with the question "What is best?," a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream. There are eras of human history in which the channels of thought have been too deeply cut and no change was possible, and nothing new ever happened, and "best" was a matter of dogma, but that is not the situation now. Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands, disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum. Some channel deepening seems called for.
What is left when honor is lost?
What? Is man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of man's?
What is not started today is never finished tomorrow.
What is so often said about the solders of the 20th century is that they fought to make us free. Which is a wonderful sentiment and one witch should evoke tremendous gratitude if in fact there was a shred of truth in that statement but, it's not true. It's not even close to true in fact it's the opposite of truth.
What is success? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing; knowing that it is not enough, that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose.
What is success? It is a toy balloon among children armed with pins.
What is this slow blue dream of living,
What is truth?
What i took away from witnessing the broken climbers in Moshi was this: *Everything is easy until it isn't.*
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.
What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.
What makes you so special?
What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him.
What man needs is not just the persistent posing of ultimate questions, but the sense of what is feasible, what is possible, what is correct, here and now. The philosopher, of all people, must, I think, be aware of the tension between what he claims to achieve and the reality in which he finds himself.
What material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter. And that is being able to make a difference, not only in your own life, but in other people's lives.
What matters creative endless toil, When, at a snatch, oblivion ends the coil?
What matters is the value we've created in our lives, the people we've made happy and how much we've grown as people.
What, more realistically, is this "mutation," the "new man"? He is the rootless man, discontinuous with a past that Nihilism has destroyed, the raw material of every demagogue's dream; the "free-thinker" and skeptic, closed only to the truth but "open" to each new intellectual fashion because he himself has no intellectual foundation; the "seeker" after some "new revelation," ready to believe anything new because true faith has been annihilated in him; the planner and experimenter, worshipping "fact" because he has abandoned truth, seeing the world as a vast laboratory in which he is free to determine what is "possible"; the autonomous man, pretending to the humility of only asking his "rights," yet full of the pride that expects everything to be given him in a world where nothing is authoritatively forbidden; the man of the moment, without conscience or values and thus at the mercy of the strongest "stimulus"; the "rebel," hating all restraint and authority because he himself is his own and only god; the "mass man," this new barbarian, thoroughly "reduced" and "simplified" and capable of only the most elementary ideas, yet scornful of anyone who presumes to point out the higher things or the real complexity of life.
What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.
What never fails inside the mind of an intellectual never works outside the confines of his head. The world's stubborn refusal to vindicate the intellectual's theories serves as proof of humanity's irrationality, not his own. Thus, the true believer retrenches rather than rethinks; he launches a war on the world, denying reality because it fails to conform to his theories. If intellectuals are not prepared to reconcile theory and practice, then why do they bother to venture outside the ivory tower or the coffeehouse? Why not stay in the world of abstractions and fantasy?
What one generation finds ridiculous, the next accepts; and the third shudders when it looks back on what the first did.
What other people think of me is none of my business.
What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them. It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.
What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
What sets us apart from animals is that we're not afraid of vacuum cleaners.
What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.
What's money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.
whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived
What's on my playlist when I'm fighting is not so much hip-hop. Sometimes, it's something more inspirational. I get a chance to think about what I'm fighting for, like, my family. It takes me to that state because a lot of times, it's a spiritual warfare for me.
What sort of philosophers are we, who know absolutely nothing of the origin and destiny of cats?
What's the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable.
What's the survival value of obsessing on a sunset?
What's the use of complaining about something you have no intentions of changing it?
What they have done in Japan, which I find so inspirational, is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door. They've made it conversational. People go out and upgrade their toilet. They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.
What we cannot bear removes us from life; what remains can be borne.
What we do not confront, we inhabit.
What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.
What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a social convenience, as, for example, money ... but it is absurd to take money too seriously, to confuse it with real wealth ... In somewhat the same way, thoughts, ideas and words are "coins" for real things.
What we hope ever to do with ease, we must learn first to do with diligence.
What we hope to do with ease, we must first learn to do with diligence.
What we must decide is how we are valuable rather than how valuable we are.
What we need is more people who specialize in the impossible.
What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass; it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998, paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today.
What we see is mainly what we look for.
What we think, we become.
What we've got here is a failure to communicate.
What would have become of Hercules do you think if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar - and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges?
What would you attempt to do if you knew you would not fail?
What would you do if you weren't afraid?
What would you do if you weren't afraid.
What you are is God's gift to you, what you become is your gift to God.
What you are is what you have been. What you'll be is what you do now.
What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
What you do today is important, because you are exchanging a day of your life for it.
What? You elected virtue and the swelled bosom and yet you leer enviously at the advantages of those without qualms? But virtue involves renouncing "advantages." (Inscription for an anti-Semite's door.)
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
What You Lack In Talent Can Be Made Up With Desire, Hustle And Giving 110% All The Time.
What? You search? You would multiply yourself by ten, by a hundred? You seek followers? Seek zeros!
When a fixed code of laws, which must be observed to the letter, leaves no further care to the judge than to examine the acts of citizens and to decide whether or not they conform to the law as written; then the standard of the just or the unjust, which is to be the norm of conduct for the ignorant as well as for the philosophic citizen, is not a matter of controversy but of fact; then only are citizens not subject to the petty tyrannies of the many which are the more cruel as the distance between the oppressed and the oppressor is less, and which are far more fatal than those of a single man, for the despotism of many can only be corrected by the despotism of one; the cruelty of a single despot is proportioned, not to his might, but to the obstacles he encounters.
when a language dies, a way of understanding the world dies with it, a way of looking at the world.
When all else fails, read the instructions.
When all the original blues guys are gone, you start to realize that someone has to tend to the tradition. I recognize that I have some responsibility to keep the music alive, and it's a pretty honorable position to be in.
When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred.
When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.
When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, "It seemed so to him."
When a small child, I thought that success spelled happiness. I was wrong, happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment, but soon flits away.
When a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty.
When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren animal."
When a youth was giving himself airs in the Theatre and saying, 'I am wise, for I have conversed with many wise men,' Epictetus replied, 'I too have conversed with many rich men, yet I am not rich!'.
When Bill Clinton ran in '92, and I listened to him, and I had of course known of his record from Arkansas, I found him extraordinarily inspirational, and I voted Democratic.
When choosing friends, be careful of those who are not willing to rise up to be at your level, but who are trying everything in their power to bring you down to their level.

When deeds speak, words are nothing.
...when dogma enters the brain, all intellectual activity ceases.
Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops.
Whenever a soul leaves the body a void is felt across the world..
Whenever I think of something but can't think of what it was I was thinking of, I can't stop thinking until I think I'm thinking of it again. I think I think too much.
Whenever you do a thing, act as if all the world were watching.
Whenever you fall, pick something up.
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.
Whenever you see a successful person you only see the public glories, never the private sacrifices to reach them.
When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.
When faith in our freedom gives way to fear of our freedom, silencing the minority view becomes the operative protocol.
When God dreams, whole universes come into existence.
When God opens his front door, it opens out onto the universe.
When God sings, there is glorious music and a choir of angels to fill the air with love.
When God takes a shower, waterfalls come to life around the world.
When God turns on his outside light, the whole universe lights up with a heavenly glow.

...when he looks at Beauty in the only way that Beauty can be seen - only then will it become possible for him to give birth not to images of virtue (because he's in touch with no images), but to true virtue [arete] (because he is in touch with true Beauty). The love of the gods belongs to anyone who has given to true virtue and nourished it, and if any human being could become immortal, it would be he.
When I dare to be powerful - to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.
When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.
When I die, I don't want people to say all good things. I'd like them to be honest and tell the truth.
When I grew up here, there was no T-Hub. Probably, the closest to T was the Tank bund.
When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.
When I meet with the founders of a new company, my advice is almost always, 'Do fewer things.' It's true of partnerships, marketing opportunities, anything that's taking up your time. The vast majority of things are distractions, and very few really matter to your success.
When I'm old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say, 'Wow, that was an adventure,' not 'Wow, I sure felt safe.
When in doubt, tell the truth.
When I ran the stock exchange, it was the most successful it's been in its 200-plus-year history. And I was rewarded for success; I would not have been rewarded if we failed.
When I say that consciousness is an illusion I do not mean that consciousness does not exist. I mean that consciousness is not what it appears to be. If it seems to be a continuous stream of rich and detailed experiences, happening one after the other to a conscious person, this is the illusion.
When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much pride. Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God. It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day. And so a child could. But with me and such as me it is different. One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet. It is so difficult to keep 'heights that the soul is competent to gain.' We think in eternity, but we move slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave whose slave it is one's chance or choice to be.
When I say "The good man gave his good dog a good meal," I use "good" analogically, for there is at the same time a similarity and a difference between a good man, a good dog, and a good meal. All three are desirable, but a good man is wise and moral, a good dog is tame and affectionate, and a good meal is tasty and nourishing. But a good man is not tasty and nourishing, except to a cannibal; a good dog is not wise and moral, except in cartoons, and a good meal is not tame and affectionate, unless it's alive as you eat it.
When I see the blind and wretched state of men, when I survey the whole universe in its deadness, and man left to himself with no light, as though lost in this corner of the universe without knowing who put him there, what he has to do, or what will become of him when he dies, incapable of knowing anything, I am moved to terror, like a man transported in his sleep to some terrifying desert island, who wakes up quite lost, with no means of escape. Then I marvel that so wretched a state does not drive people to despair.
When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, I used everything you gave me.
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.
When it comes to social consequences, they've got all different people acting in different ways, very difficult to even have a proper criterion of success. So, it's a difficult task.
When it comes to success, there are no shortcuts.
When I told the people of Northern Ireland that I was an atheist, a woman in the audience stood up and said, "Yes, but is it the God of the Catholics or the God of the Protestants in whom you don't believe?"
When it's all quiet, that's when you need to watch out for storms.
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life.  When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I wrote down ‘happy'.  They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life.
When I was a boy, I would read those postcards and know exactly why my father was doing what he was doing: he was taking a stab at greatness, that is, if greatness is simply another word for doing something different from what you were already doing--or maybe greatness is the thing we want to have so that other people will want to have us, or maybe greatness is merely the grail for our unhappy, striving selves, the thing we think we need but don't and can't get anyway.
When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.
When I was born, I was so surprised, I couldn't talk for a year and a half!
When I was in jail, I was a lot of people's favorite person. I practically ran the jail. I had more freedom than the police.
When I was working at the Sprint store, I got laid off. I was bummed out, but I stayed positive. I used the money I had earned while working there to make my first album. Without that job, maybe 'Corazon Sin Cara' would never had been made. It's a very inspirational story.
When I was young, I observed that nine out of ten things I did were failures. So I did ten times more work.

When love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece.
When man invented light, he forgot to come out of the dark ages.
When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical. He would always give you something from a movie, and you'd go, what did you just play... immediately inspirational writings, amazing. That's what we're going to miss.
When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it, but all that had gone before.
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there.
When one door closes another door opens, but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.
When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us.

When one firmly fetters one's heart and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they know it already.
When one must, one can.
When one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other is busy making mistakes and becoming superior.
When one side benefits more than the other, that's a win-lose situation. To the winner it might look like success for a while, but in the long run, it breeds resentment and distrust.
When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.
When our eyes are graced with wonder, the world reveals its wonders to us. There are people who see only dullness in the world and that is because their eyes have already been dulled. So much depends on how we look at things. The quality of our looking determines what we come to see.
When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore.
when somebody plays music, you listen. you just follow those sounds, and eventually you understand the music. the point can't be explained in words because music is not words, but after listening for a while, you understand the point of it, and that point is the music itself. in exactly the same way, you can listen to all experiences.
When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person's life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn't what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.
When spider webs unite they can tie up a lion.
When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality: humility.

When the world says, 'Give up,' hope whispers, 'Try it one more time.'
When the writing is good, a book becomes a mirror. The reader will see an uncanny familiarity and respond accordingly.
When they have discovered truth in nature they fling it into a book, where it is even worse hands.
When two creatures meet, the one that is able to intimidate its opponent is recognized as socially superior, so that a social decision does not always depend on a fight; an encounter in some circumstances may be enough.
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
When we are shown scenes of starving children in Africa, with a call for us to do something to help them, the underlying ideological message is something like: "Don't think, don't politicize, forget about the true causes of their poverty, just act, contribute money, so that you will not have to think!
When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.
When we are young, we spend much time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art, in the hope that, in the course of a few years, we shall have condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories at which the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get no completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola, whose arcs will never meet.
When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace.
When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.
When we move, we are in a way de-structured by our movement
When we say two bodies 'touch', what we mean (without knowing it) is that both electromagnetic fields are interacting to avoid physical interpenetration and ... that happens well before subatomic particles touch!
When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves.
When we sense something, it is due to the movement of atoms in space. When I see the moon it is because "moon atoms" penetrate my eye.
When we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely -- the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears- when you give your whole attention to it.

When you can't get what you want, get what you need
When you choose one way out of many, all the ways you don't take are snuffed out like candles, as if they'd never existed.
When you come to look into this argument from design, it is a most astonishing thing that people can believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with all its defects, should be the best that omnipotence and omniscience have been able to produce in millions of years. I really cannot believe it. Do you think that, if you were granted omnipotence and omniscience and millions of years in which to perfect your world, you could produce nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan or the Fascists? Moreover, if you accept the ordinary laws of science, you have to suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in due course: it is a stage in the decay of the solar system; at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm, and there is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system. You see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending -- something dead, cold, and lifeless.
When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly.

When you use your energy and resources to punish people, you run out of energy and resources to protect people.
When you've had one call after another and your little one is tugging on your shirt, remember what really matters. When the milk is splattered all over the floor and those little eyes are looking at you for your reaction, remember what really matters. It takes 5 minutes to clean up spilled milk; it takes much longer to clean up a broken spirit.
When you've tried everything and failed, try everything else and succeed
When you win, nothing hurts.
When you work for yourself, it's a real bummer when you don't like the boss!
When you write and draw in pencil, your eraser is your best friend.
Whereas I think: I'm lying here in a haystack... The tiny space I occupy is so infinitesimal in comparison with the rest of space, which I don't occupy and which has no relation to me. And the period of time in which I'm fated to live is so insignificant beside the eternity in which I haven't existed and won't exist... And yet in this atom, this mathematical point, blood is circulating, a brain is working, desiring something... What chaos! What a farce!

Where hope grows, miracles blossom.

Where in the nursery rhyme does it say Humpty Dumpty is an egg?
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

Where we choose to be, where we choose to be--we have the power to determine that in our lives. We cannot reel time backward or forward, but we can take ourselves to the place that defines our being.
Whether a belief is considered to be a delusion or not depends partly upon the intensity with which it is defended, and partly upon the numbers of people subscribing to it.
Whether a party can have much success without a woman present I must ask others to decide, but one thing is certain, no party is any fun unless seasoned with folly.
Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power," Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.
Whether divine or human, it is precisely the imagination that fashions and recognizes the universe as meaningful, abiding, and valuable, that is to say, as real.
Whether we immoralists are harming virtue? Just as little as anarchists harm princes. Only since the latter are shot at do they again sit securely on their thrones. Moral: morality must be shot at.
Whether we like it or not, modern ways are going to alter and in part destroy traditional customs and values.
Whether you come from a council estate or a country estate, your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude.
Whether you're successful or not, you'll never actually feel the joys of accomplishment unless you love yourself. Success can be very difficult to deal with. You have to stay in the center. If you let your success define you, then you're really just setting yourself up for failure.

Whoever is happy will make others happy too.
Whoever said anybody has a right to give up?
Whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword obviously never encountered automatic weapons.
Whoever will be free must make himself free. Freedom is no fairy gift to fall into a man's lap. What is freedom? To have the will to be responsible for one's self.
Whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.
Whoever you are, whatever your dream, you have to be strong in your head and strong in your heart. Be strong. There's no quitting in the person who wants it bad enough.

Who would have thought that a tap-dancing penguin would outpoint James Bond at the box office? And deserve to? Not that there's anything wrong with 'Casino Royale.' But 'Happy Feet' - written and directed by George Miller - is a complete charmer, even if, in the way of most family fare, it can't resist straying into the Inspirational.
Why are there beings at all, instead of Nothing?
why are we here?
Why be a man when you can be a success?
Why does a woman want equality with men when she is already much better than a man? Is she not a mother like the earth?
Why don't you look it into your own heart instead of looking it into the temples and mosques?

Why is abbreviation such a long word?
Why' is a crooked letter and can't be made straight.
Why is it so difficult for us to think in relative terms? Well, for the good reason that human nature loves absoluteness, and erroneously considers it as a state of higher knowledge.

William James describes a man who got the experience from laughing-gas; whenever he was under its influence, he knew the secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had forgotten it. At last, with immense effort, he wrote down the secret before the vision had faded. When completely recovered, he rushed to see what he had written. It was: "A smell of petroleum prevails throughout.

Windows NT addresses 2 Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than any application will ever need.
Winners are the ones who really listen to the truth of their hearts.
Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they're making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that's the difference.
Winning isn't everything, but it beats anything in second place.
Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is.
Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.
Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues.
Wisdom has two parts: 1) Having a lot to say, and 2) not saying it.
Wisdom is knowing what to do next, skill is knowing how to do it, and virtue is doing it.
Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it.

With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.
Within a computer natural language is unnatural.
Within sorrow is grace. When we come close to those things that break us down, we touch those things that also break us open. And in that breaking open, we uncover our true nature.

With the arrival of electric technology, man has extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself.

Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.
Women are considered profound. Why? Because one never fathoms their depths. Women aren't even shallow.
Women are more humble and more adaptable. This makes them wiser.
Women's liberation is one thing, but the permeation of anti-male sentiment in post-modern popular culture - from our mocking sitcom plots to degrading commercial story lines - stands testament to the ignorance of society. Fair or not, as the lead gender that never requested such a role, the historical male reputation is quite balanced.
Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the street with a bald head and a beer gut, and still think they are beautiful
Wonder rather than doubt is the root of all knowledge.
Words are made for a certain exactness of thought, as tears are for a certain degree of pain. What is least distinct cannot be named; what is clearest is unutterable.
Words are the clothes thoughts wear.
Words do not express thoughts very well; every thing immediately becomes a little different, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom of one man seems nonsense to another.
Work as intensely as you play and play as intensely as you work.
Work is either fun or drudgery. It depends on your attitude. I like fun.
Work will win when wishy washy wishing won t.

Write a paper promising salvation, make it a 'structured' something or a 'virtual' something, or 'abstract', 'distributed' or 'higher-order' or 'applicative' and you can almost be certain of having started a new cult.
Write it properly first. It's easier to make a correct program fast, than to make a fast program correct.
Writers, as they gain success, feel like outsiders because writers don't come together in real groups.
Writers may be classified as meteors, planets, and fixed stars. They belong not to one system, one nation only, but to the universe. And just because they are so very far away, it is usually many years before their light is visible to the inhabitants of this earth.
Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.
Writing blooms flowers for mind, which last forever.

Yes, I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can find his way by moonlight, and see the dawn before the rest of the world.
Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect, my films have done well, and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me. I really just thought this is like a strange dream. I have never thought this is a success - I don't have a standard.

Yet even in the loneliness of the canyon I knew there were others like me who had brothers they did not understand but wanted to help. We are probably those referred to as "our brother's keepers," possessed of one of the oldest and possible one of the most futile and certainly one of the most haunting instincts. It will not let us go.
Yet I'm sure there's something more to be read in a man. People dare not -- they dare not turn the page. The laws of mimicry -- I call them the laws of fear. People are afraid to find themselves alone, and don't find themselves at all. I hate this moral agoraphobia -- it's the worst kind of cowardice. You can't create something without being alone. But who's trying to create here? What seems different in yourself: that's the one rare thing you possess, the one thing which gives each of us his worth; and that's just what we try to suppress. We imitate. And we claim to love life.
Yet the ivory gods, And the ebony gods, And the gods of diamond-jade, Are only silly puppet gods That people themselves Have made.-

You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it come true. You may have to work for it, however.
You are never too good for anything. Always be willing to do everything.
You Are Never Too Old To Set Another Goal Or To Dream A New Dream.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
You are not free until you have no need to impress anybody.

You are what your creators and experiences have made you, like every other being in this universe. Accept that and be done; I tire of your whining.
You asked me how to get out of the finite dimensions when I feel like it. I certainly don't use logic when I do it. Logic's the first thing you have to get rid of.

You bring out the best in yourself by looking for the best in others.

You cannot achieve the impossible without attempting the absurd.
You cannot allow your desire to be a winner to be diminished by achieving success before and I believe there is room for improvement in every sportsman.

You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.
You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.

You have a keen sense of humor and love a good time.

You like me not because I like you. I like you just because I like me.
You'll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure.
You look at the tremendous success of Facebook. To my mind there is not a lot of commerce going on in these social networking sites. eBay is a community anchored in commerce. It is a commerce site that built a community around it. What has not been proven is if the reverse can happen and people will go to community sites to do commerce.

You never lose a dream. It just incubates as a hobby.

Young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit. Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.
Young people need the hands-on training that comes with a summer job. They need to know how to dress for success and nail job interviews. But most of all, they need mentorship, guidance, and inspiration.

It's the foundation of your vast civilization today in exactly the same way that it was the foundation of the very first farming village.

Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.
Your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself.
Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.

Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure. But it was actually really important for me to go through that. Struggle, for me, is the most inspirational thing in the world at the end of the day - as long as you treat it that way.
Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success.
Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.
Your principle should be to see everything and say nothing. The world changes so rapidly that if you want to get on you cannot afford to align yourself with any person or point of view.
Your problem isn't the problem. Your reaction is the problem.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

Your work is to discover your world and then with all your heart give yourself to it.

You show me a capitalist, and I'll show you a bloodsucker
You simply have to put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Put blinders on and plow right ahead.
You stand with the least likely to succeed until success is succeeded by something more valuable: kinship. You stand with the belligerent, the surly and the badly behaved until bad behavior is recognized for the language it is: the vocabulary of the deeply wounded and of those whose burdens are more than they can bear.

You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you can write, even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program.
Youth is an intoxication without wine, someone says. Life is an intoxication. The only sober man is the melancholiac, who, disenchanted, looks at life, sees it as it really is, and cuts his throat. If this be so, I want to be very drunk. The great thing is to live, to clutch at our existence and race away with it in some great and enthralling pursuit. Above all, I must beware of all ultimate questions- they are too maddeningly unanswerable- let me eschew philosophy and burn Omar.
You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk?
You've got to eat while you dream. You've got to deliver on short-range commitments, while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it. The success of doing both.

You've got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction.

You were designed for accomplishment, engineered for success, and endowed with the seeds of greatness.
You were free, you are free and you will be free.
You weren't born just to live a life and to die; you were born to accomplish something specifically. Matter of fact, success is making it to the end of your purpose; that is success... Success is not just existing. Success is making it to the end of why you were born.
You will always find a peaceful world in your heart and mind when you are kind.
You will attract cultured and artistic people to your home.
You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation which 'clicks.'
You will find peace everywhere when you are in love with humanity.
You will never know how high you can climb until you reach the top.
You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.
